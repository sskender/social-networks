Born in the South Jamaica neighborhood of the borough of Queens, Jackson began selling drugs at age twelve during the 1980s crack epidemic. Although he left drug-dealing to pursue a musical career, he was struck by nine bullets in a 2000 shooting. After Jackson released the compilation album Guess Who's Back? in 2002, he was discovered by Eminem and signed by Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records.\nWith the aid of Eminem and Dr. Dre (who produced his first major-label album, Get Rich or Die Tryin'), Jackson became one of the world's best selling rappers and rose to prominence with East Coast hip hop group G-Unit (which he leads de facto). In 2003 he founded G-Unit Records, signing his G-Unit associates Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. Jackson had similar commercial and critical success with his second album, The Massacre, which was released in 2005. He released his fifth studio album, Animal Ambition, in 2014 and is working on his sixth studio album: Street King Immortal, scheduled for release in 2016.\nDuring his career Jackson has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and won several awards, including a Grammy Award, thirteen Billboard Music Awards, six World Music Awards, three American Music Awards and four BET Awards. He has pursued an acting career, appearing in the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2005), the Iraq War film Home of the Brave (2006) and Righteous Kill (2008). 50 Cent was ranked the sixth-best artist of the 2000s, the third-best rapper (behind Eminem and Nelly), and Get Rich or Die Tryin' and The Massacre were ranked the 12th and 37th best albums of the decade by Billboard.",

A fourth member, rapper Jarobi White, left the group after their first album but rejoined in 1991. Along with De La Soul, the group was a central part of the Native Tongues Posse, and enjoyed the most commercial success out of all the groups to emerge from that collective. Many of their songs, such as \"Bonita Applebum\", \"Can I Kick It?\", \"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo\", \"Scenario\", \"Check the Rhime\", \"Jazz (We've Got)\", \"Award Tour\" and \"Electric Relaxation\" are regarded as classics by the hip hop community.\nThey released five albums between 1990 and 1998; the group disbanded in 1998. In 2006, the group reunited and toured the U.S., and planned to release a new album. The group is regarded as iconic pioneers of alternative hip hop music, having helped to pave the way for innovative hip hop artists. John Bush of Allmusic called them \"the most intelligent, artistic rap group during the 1990s,\" while the editors of About.com ranked them #4 on their list of the \"25 Best Rap Groups of All Time.\" In 2005, A Tribe Called Quest received a Special Achievement Award at the Billboard R&B Hip-Hop Awards in Atlanta.

        "strBiographyEN" : "ABBA was a Swedish pop/rock group formed in Stockholm in 1972, comprising Agnetha Fältskog, Benny Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. ABBA is an acronym of the band member's first names. They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of pop music, topping the charts worldwide from 1972 to 1982. They are also known for winning the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest, giving Sweden its first victory in the history of the contest and being the most successful group ever to take part in the contest.\nABBA has sold over 370 million records worldwide and still sell millions of records a year, which makes them one of the best-selling music artists. ABBA was the first pop group to come from a non-English-speaking country that enjoyed consistent success in the charts of English-speaking countries, including the UK, Ireland, the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The group also enjoyed significant success in Latin American markets, and recorded a collection of their hit songs in Spanish.\nDuring the band's active years, Fältskog and Ulvaeus were a married couple, as were Lyngstad and Andersson, although both couples later divorced. At the height of their popularity, both relationships were suffering strain which ultimately resulted in the collapse of the Ulvaeus-Fältskog marriage in 1979 and the Andersson-Lyngstad marriage in 1981. As a result, these relationship changes began appearing in the group's music, and later compositions produced more introspective lyrics.\nAfter ABBA broke up in late 1982, Andersson and Ulvaeus achieved success writing music for the stage while Lyngstad and Fältskog pursued individual solo careers with mixed success. ABBA's music declined in popularity until several films, notably Muriel's Wedding and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, revived interest in the group, spawning several tribute bands. In 1999, ABBA's music was adapted into the successful musical Mamma Mia! that toured worldwide. A film of the same name released in 2008 became the highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom that year. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 15 March 2010.\nBenny Andersson (born 16 December 1946 in Stockholm, Sweden) became (at age 18) the member of a popular Swedish pop-rock group, The Hep Stars, that performed covers of international hits. The Hep Stars were known as \"The Swedish Beatles\". They also set up Hep House, their equivalent of Apple Corps. Andersson played the keyboard and eventually started writing original songs for his band, many of which became major hits including \"No Response\" that hit number 3 in 1965, \"Sunny Girl\", \"Wedding\" and \"Consolation\", all of which hit number 1 in 1966. Andersson also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with Lasse Berghagen, with whom he wrote his first Svensktoppen entry \"Sagan om lilla Sofi\" (\"The Story of Little Sophie\") in 1968.\nBjörn Ulvaeus (born 25 April 1945 in Gothenburg/Göteborg, Sweden) also began his musical career at 18 (as a singer and guitarist), when he fronted The Hootenanny Singers, a popular Swedish folk-skiffle group. Ulvaeus started writing English-language songs for his group, and even had a brief solo career alongside. The Hootenanny Singers and The Hep Stars sometimes crossed paths while touring. In June 1966, Ulvaeus and Andersson decided to write a song together. Their first attempt was \"Isn't It Easy to Say\", a song later recorded by The Hep Stars. Stig Anderson was the manager of The Hootenanny Singers and founder of the Polar Music label. He saw potential in the collaboration, and encouraged them to write more. Both also began playing occasionally with the other's bands on stage and on record, although it was not until 1969 that the pair wrote and produced some of their first real hits together: \"Ljuva sextital\" (\"Merry Sixties\"), recorded by Brita Borg, and The Hep Stars' 1969 hit \"Speleman\" (\"Fiddler\").\nAfter the 1970 release of Lycka, two more singles credited to 'Björn & Benny' were released in Sweden, \"Det kan ingen doktor hjälpa\" (\"No Doctor Can Help with That\") and \"Tänk om jorden vore ung\" (\"Imagine If the Earth Were Young\"), with more prominent vocals by Fältskog and Lyngstad-and moderate chart success.\nFältskog and Ulvaeus were married on 6 July 1971. They and Andersson started performing together on a regular basis at the Swedish folkparks during the summer of that year.\nStig Anderson, founder and owner of Polar Music, was determined to break into the mainstream international market with music by Andersson and Ulvaeus. \"One day the pair of you will write a song that becomes a worldwide hit\", he predicted. Stig Anderson encouraged Ulvaeus and Andersson to write a song for Melodifestivalen, and after two rejected entries in 1971, Andersson and Ulvaeus submitted their new song \"Säg det med en sÃ¥ng\" (\"Say It with a Song\") for the 1972 contest, choosing newcomer Lena Anderson to perform. The song came in third place, encouraging Stig Anderson, and became a hit in Sweden.\nThe first signs of foreign success came as a surprise, as the Andersson and Ulvaeus single \"She's My Kind of Girl\" was released through Epic Records in Japan in March 1972, giving the duo a Top 10 hit. Two more singles were released in Japan, \"En Carousel\" (\"En Karusell\" in Scandinavia, an earlier version of \"Merry-Go-Round\") and \"Love Has Its Ways\" (a song they wrote with Koichi Morita).",

She was the first of two daughters of department store manager Knut Ingvar Fältskog (1922—1995) and his wife Birgit Margareta Johansson (1923—1994). Ingvar Fältskog showed much interest in music and showbusiness, whereas Birgit Fältskog was a very calm and careful woman who devoted herself to her children and household. Fältskog cites Connie Francis, Marianne Faithfull, Aretha Franklin and Lesley Gore as her strongest musical influences.\nFältskog wrote her first song at the age of six, entitled \"Två små troll\" (\"Two Little Trolls\"). In 1958, she began taking piano lessons, and also sang in a local church choir. In early 1960, Fältskog formed a musical trio, The Cambers, with her friends Lena Johansson and Elisabeth Strub. They performed locally in minor venues and soon dissolved due to a lack of engagements. At age 15, Fältskog decided to leave school and pursue a career.\nShe achieved success in Sweden after the release of her début album Agnetha Fältskog in 1968, and reached international stardom as a member of the pop group ABBA, which has sold over 370 million albums and singles worldwide, making them one of the best–selling music artists in history and the second or third best–selling band in history.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "AC/DC are an Australian hard rock band, formed in November 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young, who continued as members until Malcolm's illness and departure in 2014. Commonly referred to as a hard rock or blues rock band, they are also considered pioneers of heavy metal and are sometimes classified as such, though they have always dubbed their music as simply \"rock and roll\".\nAC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, on 17 February 1975; Malcolm and Angus were the only original members left in the band. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller.\nThe band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. AC/DC declined in popularity soon after drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and was replaced by ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright, who left to join Dio in 1989. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip was released in 2000 and was well received by critics. The band's studio album, Black Ice, was released on 20 October 2008 and was the second-highest-selling album of that year. It was their biggest hit on the charts since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide. The band's line-up remained the same—their longest unchanged line-up—until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement and Rudd's legal troubles.\nAC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the United States alone, making them the tenth-best-selling band in the United States and one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-selling album by any artist – and the third-highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 22 million units in the US alone, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" and were named the seventh \"Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time\" by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as \"the greatest rock and roll band of all time.\"In 2010, AC/DC were ranked number 23 in the VH1 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Aerosmith is an American rock band, sometimes referred to as \"The Bad Boys from Boston\" and \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band.\" Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has come to also incorporate elements of pop, heavy metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. The band was formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. Guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Tom Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with singer Steven Tyler, drummer Joey Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston.\nThey were signed to Columbia Records in 1972, and released a string of multi-platinum albums, beginning with their 1973 eponymous debut album, followed by their 1974 album Get Your Wings. In 1975, the band broke into the mainstream with the album Toys in the Attic, and their 1976 follow-up Rocks cemented their status as hard rock superstars. The band released two more albums, toured extensively, and charted a string of Hot 100 singles. By the end of the 1970s, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a loyal following of fans, often referred to as the \"Blue Army\". However, drug addiction and internal conflict took their toll on the band, which resulted in the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981, respectively; they were replaced by Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay. The band did not fare well between 1980 and 1984, releasing a lone album, Rock in a Hard Place, which went gold but failed to match their previous successes.\nPerry and Whitford returned in 1984 and the band signed a new deal with Geffen Records. After a comeback tour, the band recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which won some critical praise but failed to come close to commercial expectations. It was not until the band sobered up and released 1987's Permanent Vacation that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s. Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997). The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television, film, and video games. Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock 'n' roll history. Additional albums followed in 2001 and 2004. After 42 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music. Their upcoming album, Music from Another Dimension, is expected to be released November 6, 2012.\nAerosmith is the best-selling American rock band of all time, having sold more than 150 million albums worldwide, including 66.5 million albums in the United States alone. They also hold the record for the most gold and multi-platinum albums by an American group. The band has scored 21 Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, nine number-one Mainstream Rock hits, four Grammy Awards, and ten MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and were included among both Rolling Stone's and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Albert Greene (born April 13, 1946), better known as Al Green, is an American gospel and soul music singer. He reached the peak of his popularity in the 1970s, with hit singles such as \"You Oughta Be With Me\", \"I'm Still In Love With You\", \"Love and Happiness\", and \"Let's Stay Together\". In 2005, Rolling Stone named him #66 in their list of the '100 Greatest Artists of All Time'. The nomination stated that \"people are born to do certain things, and Al was born to make us smile.\" The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Green in 1995, referring to him as \"one of the most gifted purveyors of soul music.\" Green has sold more than 20 million records.\n\nGreen was born in Forrest City, Arkansas. He was the sixth of ten children born to Robert and Cora Greene. The son of a sharecropper, he started performing at age ten in a Forrest City quartet called the Greene Brothers; he dropped the final \"E\" from his last name years later as a solo artist. They toured extensively in the mid-1950s in the South until the Greenes moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, when they began to tour around Michigan. His father kicked him out of the group because he caught Green listening to Jackie Wilson.\n\nGreen formed a group called Al Greene & the Creations in high school. Curtis Rogers and Palmer James, two members of the Creations, formed an independent label called Hot Line Music Journal. In 1967, under the new name Al Greene & the Soul Mates, the band recorded \"Back Up Train\" and released it on Hot Line Music; the song was an R&B chart hit. The Soul Mates' subsequent singles did not sell as well. Al Green's debut LP Back Up Train was released on Hot Line in 1967. The album was upbeat and soulful but didn't do well in sales. This was the only album on the Hot Line label. Green came into contact with band leader Willie Mitchell of Memphis' Hi Records in 1969, when Mitchell hired him as a vocalist for a Texas show with Mitchell's band and then asked him to sign with the label.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Alice Cooper (the musician Vincent Damon Furnier)\n\nAlice Cooper (born Vincent Damon Furnier; February 4, 1948) is an American rock singer, songwriter, and musician whose career spans more than four decades. With a stage show that features guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, boa constrictors, and baby dolls, Cooper has drawn equally from horror movies, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a grandly theatrical and violent brand of heavy metal designed to shock people.\n\nOriginating in Detroit in the late 1960s, Alice Cooper was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica, lead guitarist Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar, Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar, and drummer Neal Smith. The original Alice Cooper band broke into the international music mainstream with the 1971 hit \"I'm Eighteen\" from the album Love It to Death, which was followed by the even bigger single \"School's Out\" in 1972. The band reached their commercial peak with the 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies.\n\nFurnier's solo career as Alice Cooper, adopting the band's name as his own name, began with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare; in 2011 he released Welcome 2 My Nightmare, his 19th album as a solo artist, and his 26th album in total. Expanding from his Detroit rock roots, in his career Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles, including conceptual rock, art rock, hard rock, New Wave, pop rock, experimental rock and industrial rock.\n\nAlice Cooper is known for his social and witty persona offstage; The Rolling Stone Album Guide has called him the world's most \"beloved heavy metal entertainer\". Cooper is credited with helping to shape the sound and look of heavy metal, and he is regarded as being the artist who \"first introduced horror imagery to rock'n'roll, and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre\". Away from music, Cooper is a film actor, a golfing celebrity, a restaurateur and, since 2004, a popular radio DJ with his classic rock show Nights with Alice Cooper.\n\nIn 2011 the original Alice Cooper band was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "This is the band Alice Cooper which ended in 1975. Please see other entry for the Solo Artist Alice Cooper\n\nAlice Cooper was an American rock band formed in Phoenix, Arizona in 1964. The band consisted of lead singer Vince Furnier, Glen Buxton (lead guitar), Michael Bruce (rhythm guitar, keyboards), Dennis Dunaway (bass guitar), and Neal Smith (drums). Furnier legally changed his name to Alice Cooper and has had a solo career under that name since the band became inactive in 1975. The band was notorious for their elaborate, theatrical shock rock stage shows. In 2011, the original Alice Cooper band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nAfter several years of little success, the Alice Cooper band rose to fame in 1971 with the success of the single \"I'm Eighteen\" and the album Love It to Death. The band peaked in popularity in 1973 with the album Billion Dollar Babies and its tour, which broke box-office records previously held by The Rolling Stones.\n\nThe band consisted of former members from the previous 60s garage rock band, the Spiders. They created everything as a group and wrote virtually the lion's share of what was to become the classic Alice Cooper canon. Neal Smith's sister Cindy Smith Dunaway (Dennis Dunaway's wife) designed the band's costumes and also performed in the stage show (she was the \"dancing tooth\" during the band's Billion Dollar Babies tour).\n\nThe Alice Cooper band was the subject of media criticism after Furnier (Alice Cooper) threw a live chicken into the audience during the 1969 Toronto Rock 'n' Roll Revival Festival. The audience ripped the chicken to shreds.\n\nThe band was featured on a Warner Bros sampler album Zapped of bands produced by Frank Zappa for the label, and then went on to release several chart-topping albums and headlining major tours before breaking up in 1975. Vincent Furnier took \"Alice Cooper\" as his own name and carried on with a new group of musicians, the original band becoming officially defunct. The band played their final show on April 8, 1974 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nBruce, Dunaway and Smith would go on to form the short-lived band Billion Dollar Babies, producing one album - Battle Axe - in 1977. While occasionally performing with one another and Glen Buxton, they would not reunite with Alice until October 23, 1999, at the second Glen Buxton Memorial Weekend for a show at CoopersTown in Phoenix (Buxton having died in 1997). They reunited for another show, with Steve Hunter on guitar, on December 16, 2010, at the Dodge Theatre in Phoenix. This lineup would perform together again (televised) on March 14, 2011, at the induction of the original Alice Cooper group into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as on May 11, 2011, at London's Battersea Power Station at the Jagermiester Ice Cold 4D event (webcast). Bruce, Dunaway and Smith appeared on three tracks they co-wrote on Alice's 2011 album Welcome 2 My Nightmare.\n\nA documentary about the Alice Cooper band entitled Super Duper Alice Cooper premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 17, 2014, and was scheduled to be screened at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival a week later.\n\nOn October 6, 2015, a surprise reunion show took place in Dallas at Dunaway's book signing session where he was joined by Bruce, Smith, Cooper and Ryan Roxie, who replaced the late Glen Buxton. The surviving members of the band are set to record and release an album with Cooper in 2016.",

William DuVall joined the band in 2006 as co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, replacing Staley, who died in 2002. The band took its name from Staley's previous group, the glam metal band Alice N' Chains.\n\nOften associated with grunge music, Alice in Chains' sound incorporates heavy metal elements. The band is known for its distinctive vocal style, which often included the harmonized vocals between Staley and Cantrell (and later Cantrell and DuVall). Cantrell started to sing lead vocals on the 1992 acoustic EP Sap, and his role continued to grow in the following albums, making Alice in Chains a two-vocal band.\n\nAlice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. They achieved success during the era with the albums Facelift (1990), Dirt (1992), Alice in Chains (1995), as well as the EP Jar of Flies (1994). Although never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onward, due to Staley's substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002. The band toured in 2006, with DuVall taking over as lead vocalist full-time. The new line-up have released the albums Black Gives Way to Blue (2009), The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here (2013), and Rainier Fog (2018).\n\nAlice in Chains have sold over 30 million records worldwide, and over 14 million records in the US alone. The band has had 18 Top 10 songs on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, 5 No. 1 hits, and received 11 Grammy Award nominations. The band was ranked number 34 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock and was ranked as the 15th greatest live band by Hit Parader.

They also received nominations for the Best Alternative Music Album Grammy for all three of their studio albums. The band's work has also been twice named as a short list nominee for the Polaris Music Prize in 2007 for Neon Bible and in 2011 for The Suburbs, winning the award for The Suburbs.\n\nWin Butler and Josh Deu began performing in Boston as Arcade Fire before moving to Montreal in 2001, recording the \"2001 Demos\" prior to their arrival in the city. The earliest Montreal-based incarnation of Arcade Fire began performing in the summer/fall of 2001, almost entirely in lofts and art galleries. One of the earliest shows took place at a Christian music festival, Inside Out Soul Festival, and later at a Montreal battle of the bands (other early shows took place at Concordia University's Faculty of Fine Arts VAV Gallery; later the group played the 2001 Christmas party of that faculty's MFA programme). At that time, the band consisted of future husband and wife Win Butler and Régine Chassagne, singer, guitarist, collaborator and original band co-founder Josh Deu, bassist Myles Broscoe (later of Les Angles Morts, Crystal Clyffs, and AIDS Wolf), guitarist/drummer Dane Mills (later of Crackpot), and multi-instrumentalist Brendan Reed (later of Les Angles Morts and founding member of Clues), who lived with Butler and Chassagne in Montreal's Mile End neighbourhood at the time and was a collaborator with them on song-writing and arrangement (2001-2003).\n\nThe initial Montreal structure of the band began to dissolve in the summer of 2002, when they travelled to Butler's family ranch in Maine to record their self-titled EP. Tension between Butler and Broscoe led the latter to exit the band following the recording session. Richard Reed Parry, who had been enlisted to help the band record, began to collaborate with them during the sessions and would go on to join the band shortly afterwards. In the winter of 2003, the band celebrated the release of its EP with a show at Montreal's Casa del Popolo. Before a crowd packed beyond capacity, the band's set ended (in the middle of an encore) with an argument between Butler and Reed, who quit the band on-stage. Mills told gathered friends in the crowd immediately thereafter that he considered the band to have broken up, as such resigning from the band as well. Following the on-stage implosion, Win's brother William Butler (subject of the early Arcade Fire song \"William Pierce Butler\") and Tim Kingsbury were brought in to replace Reed and Mills so that the band could continue, and they set out to promote the self-titled EP. The eponymous release (often referred to by fans as the Us Kids Know EP) was sold at early shows. After the band achieved fame, the EP was subsequently remastered and given a full release.\n\nThe promise shown by the new band in its early live shows allowed them to land a record contract with the independent record label, Merge Records, before the end of its first year together.\n\nWhen asked about the rumour that the band's name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: \"It's not a rumour, it's based on a story that someone told me. It's not an actual event, but one that I took to be real. I would say that it's probably something that the kid made up, but at the time I believed him.\"",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Arctic Monkeys are an English indie rock band. Formed in 2002 in High Green, a suburb of Sheffield, the band currently consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, lead/rhythm guitar), Jamie Cook (rhythm/lead guitar), Nick O'Malley (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Matt Helders (drums, backing vocals). Former members include Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Glyn Jones (lead vocals, rhythm guitar).\n\nThe band have released four studio albums: Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), Favourite Worst Nightmare (2007), Humbug (2009) and Suck It and See (2011), as well as one live album At the Apollo (2008). The band's debut album became the fastest-selling debut album in British music history, surpassing Oasis' Definitely Maybe and remains the fastest-selling debut album for a band in the UK.\nArctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first group of acts to come to the public attention via the Internet (fan-based sites rather than from the band), with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. The band are also regarded as one of the most prominent bands to be part of the post-punk revival in the UK, after achieving commercial success and spawning two number one singles with their debut album.\n\nThe band began rehearsing at Yellow Arch Studios in Neepsend, and played their first gig on 13 June 2003 at The Grapes in Sheffield city-centre. After a few performances in 2003, the band began to record demos at 2fly studios in Sheffield. 17 songs were demoed in all and the collection, now known as Beneath the Boardwalk, was burned on to CDs to give away at gigs, which were promptly file-shared amongst fans. The name Beneath the Boardwalk originated when the first batch of demos were sent around. The first sender, wanting to classify the demos, named them after where he received them, the Boardwalk. Slowly, as more demos were spread, they were all classified under this name. This has led to many people falsely believing that Beneath the Boardwalk was an early album, or that the early demos were all released under this heading. The group did not mind the distribution, saying \"we never made those demos to make money or anything. We were giving them away free anyway - that was a better way for people to hear them.\", admitting that they did not even know how to get their songs onto the Internet. When asked about the popularity of the band's MySpace site in an interview with Prefix Magazine, the band said that they were unaware what it was, and that the site had originally been created by their fans.\nThe band began to grow in popularity across the north of England, receiving attention from BBC Radio and the British tabloid press. A local amateur photographer, Mark Bull, filmed the band's performances and made the music video \"Fake Tales of San Francisco\", releasing it on his website, alongside the contents of Beneath the Boardwalk - a collection of the band's songs which he named after a local music venue. In May 2005, Arctic Monkeys released their first single, Five Minutes with Arctic Monkeys on their own 'Bang Bang' label, featuring the songs \"Fake Tales of San Francisco\" and \"From the Ritz to the Rubble\". This release was limited to 500 CDs and 1,000 7\" records, but was also available to download from the iTunes Music Store. Soon after, the band played at the Carling Stage of the Reading and Leeds Festivals, reserved for less known or unsigned bands. Their appearance was hyped by much of the music press and the band was watched by an unusually large crowd.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Aretha Louise Franklin (born March 25, 1942) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and pianist. In a recording career that has spanned over half a century, Franklin's repertoire has included gospel, jazz, blues, R&B, pop, rock and funk. Franklin is known as one of the most important popularizers of the soul music genre and is referred to as the Queen of Soul, a title she was given early in her career. Franklin, the daughter of prominent Baptist minister and activist C. L. Franklin, began her singing career singing in her father's church at the age of ten and started recording four years later. After several years in the gospel circuit and with her father's blessing, she formed a secular pop music career at the age of eighteen, signing with Columbia Records, where she was branded by its CEO John Hammond as his most important act since Billie Holiday. Franklin's Columbia period wasn't as successful as hoped and in late 1966, Franklin switched over to Atlantic Records, where she began recording a string of popular hits including \"I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)\", \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\", \"Think\", \"Chain of Fools\" and what later became her signature song, \"Respect\".\n\nAfter a brief lull in 1969, Franklin continued to record a string of popular singles throughout the early 1970s, reaching her peak as an albums artist with 1970's Spirit in the Dark, 1971's Young, Gifted & Black and the 1972 gospel record, Amazing Grace, which later became one of the best-selling gospel albums of all time and was the biggest-selling album in gospel music for over 25 years. Franklin's success in Atlantic peaked after the release of the singles, \"Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)\", \"I'm in Love\" and \"Giving Him Something He Can Feel\" and the 1976 soundtrack to the movie, Sparkle and Franklin left the label in 1980 to sign with Clive Davis' Arista Records label where she switched over from soul and funk music to a more conservative urban adult contemporary sound in the albums, Aretha and Love All the Hurt Away, before regaining commercial success with the 1982 album, Jump to It, produced by R&B hitmaker Luther Vandross. In 1984, Franklin added modern day pop rock and dance elements to her sound, which was integral to the success of her 1985 album, Who's Zoomin' Who?, which spawned the hits \"Freeway of Love\", \"Who's Zoomin' Who\" and the Eurythmics featured \"Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves\". The 1986 release of Aretha featured her last number-one hit single with the George Michael duet \"I Knew You Were Waiting for Me\". Afterwards Franklin returned to a lull in her career until the release of 1998's A Rose Is Still a Rose, which incorporated modern day contemporary R&B and which the title track returned Franklin to the top 40 of the pop charts.\n\nRolling Stone magazine ranked her atop its \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\" list, as well as the ninth greatest artist of all time. She has won 18 Grammys and received two honorary Grammys. In 1987, Franklin became the first female artist to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Franklin is planned to be inducted to the GMA Gospel Music Hall of Fame in August 2012.",

She began her career in the Broadway musical 13, before landing the role of Cat Valentine on the Nickelodeon television series Victorious in 2009. After four seasons, the show ended, and Grande starred on the spinoff, Sam & Cat, which ended in 2014. She has also appeared in other theatre, television and film roles and lent her voice to animated television and films.\n\nGrande's music career began with the soundtrack Music from Victorious (2011). She signed a recording contract with Republic Records and released her debut studio album Yours Truly in 2013, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200. The album's lead single, \"The Way\", reached the top-ten of the Billboard Hot 100, with critics comparing her wide vocal range to Mariah Carey's.\n\nGrande's second studio album, My Everything (2014), also reached number one in the United States. With the singles \"Problem\", \"Break Free\", \"Bang Bang\" and \"Love Me Harder\" from that album, she spent 34 continuous weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 and had the most top 10 singles of any artist in 2014. In 2015, she promoted My Everything with her first world tour titled The Honeymoon Tour and guest-starred in Fox comedy-horror TV series Scream Queens. In 2015, Grande released the lead single \"Focus\" from her upcoming third album Moonlight, released a holiday EP album, Christmas & Chill, and she was heard on several collaborative projects.\n\nGrande's accolades include two American Music Awards, Music Business Association's Breakthrough Artist of the Year, an MTV Video Music Award, an MTV Europe Music Award and two Grammy Award nominations.\n\nAriana Grande-Butera was born in Boca Raton, Florida, to Joan Grande, chief executive officer of telephone and alarm system company Hose-McCann Communications, and Edward Butera, who owns a graphic design firm in Boca Raton. Her name was originally inspired by Princess Oriana from Felix the Cat (1959). Grande is of Italian descent, half Sicilian and half Abruzzese. She has experienced hypoglycemia. She has an older half-brother, Frankie Grande, who is an actor, dancer, and producer. Grande's mother moved with her father from New York to Florida when she was pregnant with her.

She attended Pine Crest School and North Broward Preparatory School.\n\nBy age 13, she became serious about pursuing a music career, though she still concentrated on theater. When she first arrived in Los Angeles to meet with her managers, she expressed a desire to record an R&B album when she was 14: \"I was like, 'I want to make an R&B album,' They were like 'Um, that's a helluva goal! Who is going to buy a 14-year-old's R&B album?!'\" In 2008, Grande was cast in the supporting role of cheerleader Charlotte in the musical 13 on Broadway, for which she won a National Youth Theatre Association Award. When she joined the musical, Grande left her high school, North Broward Preparatory School, but continued to be enrolled. The school sent materials to her so she could study with tutors. She also sang various times at the New York City Jazz club Birdland.",

Critics initially described Audioslave as an amalgamation of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, it was noted that they had established a separate identity.\n\nAudioslave's trademark sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals.\n\nAfter Audioslave released three successful albums, received three Grammy nominations, and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba, Cornell issued a statement in February 2007 announcing that he was permanently leaving the band \"due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences.\" The 2007 Rage Against the Machine reunion and tour involving three members as well as solo albums released that same year by Morello and Cornell cemented the supergroup's permanent demise.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Riley B. King (born September 16, 1925), known by the stage name B.B. King, is an African-American blues songwriter, vocalist and guitarist.\nRolling Stone magazine ranked him at No. 6 on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time (previously ranked No. 3 in the 2003 edition of the same list), and he was ranked No. 17 in Gibson's Top 50 Guitarists of All Time. According to Edward M. Komara, King \"introduced a sophisticated style of soloing based on fluid string bending and shimmering vibrato that would influence virtually every electric blues guitarist that followed.\" King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. He is considered one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, because of this he is often nicknamed 'The King of Blues'. He is also known for performing tirelessly throughout his musical career appearing at 250-300 concerts per year until his seventies. In 1956 it was noted that he appeared at 342 shows, and still at the age of 87 King appears at 100 shows a year.\nOver the years, King has developed one of the world's most identifiable guitar styles. He borrowed from Blind Lemon Jefferson, T-Bone Walker and others, integrating his precise and complex vocal-like string bends and his left hand vibrato, both of which have become indispensable components of rock guitarist's vocabulary. His economy and phrasing has been a model for thousands of players, from Eric Clapton and George Harrison to Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck. King has mixed blues, jazz, swing, mainstream pop and jump into a unique sound. In King's words, \"When I sing, I play in my mind; the minute I stop singing orally, I start to sing by playing Lucille.\"",

Gizzle”, The rapper is often referred to as simply B.G…\n\nChristopher “Doogie” Dorsey was a normal kid growing up in the 13th Ward of New Orleans which is Uptown. In elementary school, young Dorsey rapped as a hobby. When Dorsey was 12, his father was murdered in a robbery, and young Dorsey drifted into street life. Dorsey began selling marijuana, cocaine, and eventually heroin — to which he later became addicted.\n\nThis time, local independent rap label Cash Money Records was looking for new talent, and Dorsey was recommended to the label by his barber, who also happened to cut the hair of the Cash Money CEO brothers Brian “Baby” Williams and Ronald “Slim” Williams. After an impromptu audition, Dorsey was signed to the budding label. His first effort was True Story, album as a part of The B.G.’z, group whom he formed with another preteen rapper, Baby D (who will later become Lil Wayne). Originally his moniker was “Doogie” or “Gangsta D”, but since “True Story” was considered his solo CD, pseudonym B.G. stuck to him.\n\nThe second youngest artist signed to Cash Money Records, Dorsey, given the stage name “B.G.” (“Baby Gangsta”), released his debut LP, True Story, in 1992 at the young age of 12. (Lil Wayne signed at 11) As the only Cash Money artist to survive several roster purges, B.G. was instrumental in helping carry Cash Money to regional fame. Multi-millionaire label head Brian Williams, who also became an artist for the label under the name “Baby”, allowed B.G. to catapult to success. ",

        "strBiographyEN" : "BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; Japanese: 防弾少年団), is a South Korean boy group formed by Big Hit Entertainment. The group's name in Korean and Japanese both directly translate to \"bulletproof boy scouts”. On July 4, 2017, BTS officially \"re-branded\" the acronym of BTS to stand for \"Beyond The Scene\". The group debuted on June 12, 2013 with the single \"No More Dream\", followed by \"We Are Bulletproof Pt.2\". The group’s members are: RM (Hangul: 김남준, Kim Namjoon, previously known as Rap Monster), Jin (Hangul: 김석진, Kim Seokjin), Suga (Hangul: 민윤기, Min Yoongi, also known as Agust D), j-hope (Hangul: 정호석, Jung Hoseok), Jimin (Hangul: 박지민, Park Jimin), V (뷔) (Hangul: 김태형, Kim Taehyung), and Jungkook (Hangul: 전정국, Jeon Jungkook).\n\nOriginally created as a duo consisting of Kim Namjoon (Rap Monster), and IRON (아이언), Big Hit Entertainment went on to search for more members through their auditions. It had already been determined that Rap Monster, who had been an underground rapper before debuting, would be the leader of the group. Jin was streetcast to audition while he was a film arts student at Konkuk University and Suga was an underground rapper in Daegu before he auditioned. J-Hope was active in the underground dancing scene before auditioning, while Jimin entered Busan High School of Arts as the top student in modern dance before his audition. V successfully auditioned for Big Hit in Daegu, then transferred to Korea Arts High School with Jimin. Jungkook auditioned for the talent search program, Superstar K, and, after he left the show, he was cast by multiple agencies. Jungkook ended up choosing Big Hit after witnessing Rap Monster perform. Former member trainee, Jin Hyosang, is currently known as Kidoh and is a member of Stardom Entertainment's Topp Dogg. Former, as well as current members, have been featured on tracks of labelmates such as Lim Jeonghee's \"Ashes,\" Jokwon's \"Animal,\" Lee Hyun's \"Bad Girl\", Kan Miyeon's \"Because I am a Stupid Woman,\" as well as some 2AM tracks.\n\nBTS released their debut single album \"2 Cool 4 Skool\" on June 12, 2013, which consists of 7 tracks. This is considered the beginning of their “school trilogy”. They released two music videos for their debut: one for the title track, “No More Dream”, and another for “We Are Bulletproof Pt.2”. Then, on September 6, 2013, BTS' first mini album, \"O!Rul8,2?\" (Oh, Are You Late Too?), was released. It features the title track, “N.O”, along with nine other tracks. Continuing the school theme, they released their second mini album, \"Skool Luv Affair\", on February 12, 2014. The mini album features ten tracks, including the lead single, “상남자 (Boy In Luv)”, and the follow up song, “하루만 (Just One Day)”. On May 14, 2014, the group released a special repackage of the mini album, “Skool Luv Affair Special Addition”. It included a CD, 2 DVDs of the group’s showcase, and, in addition to the original tracklist, two new tracks: “Miss Right” and “좋아요 (Slow Jam Remix)”.\n\nOn August 20, 2014, they released their first full-length album, \"DARK&WILD\". It contains 14 tracks, including the title track, “Danger”, and the follow up single, “호르몬 전쟁 (War of Hormone)”.\n\nThey released their first Japanese album \"WAKE UP\" on December 24, 2014. The album features 13 tracks, including the Japanese versions of \"No More Dream\", \"Boy in Luv\", and \"Danger\", as well as two original Japanese songs: \"The Stars\" and \"Wake Up\".  \n\nThe group kicked off their 화양연화 (The Most Beautiful Moment in Life) trilogy with the release of their third mini album, \"화양연화 PT.1\", on April 29, 2015. The mini album features nine tracks, including the title track, “I Need U”, and the follow up single, “쩔어 DOPE”. The second part, \"화양연화 PT.2\", was released on November 30, 2015, and expands on the narrative from Part 1. The mini album features nine tracks, including the title song, “Run”. The last part of their 화양연화 trilogy, \"화양연화 Young Forever\", was released on May 2, 2016, and is a special album that features songs from 화양연화 PT.1 & PT.2, three new songs, and several new remixes. It was supported with the release of three music videos for the album’s three new songs: “불타오르네 (FIRE)”, “Save Me”, and “EPILOGUE : Young Forever”. The entire trilogy focuses on the theme of “youth” and is considered by some as the group’s turning point in musicality and popularity.\n\nBTS released their second Japanese album, \"YOUTH\" on September 7, 2016. The album features 13 tracks, including Japanese versions of \"I Need U\", \"Run\", \"Fire\", and \"Save Me\", as well as three new original Japanese songs: \"Good Day\", \"Wishing On a Star\", and \"For You\". \n\nOn October 10, 2016, the group released their second full length album \"WINGS\". The album consists of 15 tracks, including the title track, \"피 땀 눈물 (Blood Sweat & Tears)\", and a solo track for each of the seven members. The seven short films that acted as teasers for the album and the music video for “피 땀 눈물 (Blood Sweat & Tears)” are all heavily influenced by the novel Demian by Hermann Hesse, as confirmed by the group.\n\nFollowing the immense success of WINGS, BTS announced that they would be releasing an extension to their second album that would contain stories that they hadn’t been able to include in its initial release. On February 13, 2017, the repackage of their second album, “You Never Walk Alone”, was released and it includes three new tracks: “Spring Day”, \"Not Today”, and “A Supplementary Story: You Never Walk Alone”. It also includes an extended version of a previous track, “Outro: Wings”. Two music videos were released to go along with the album: one for the title track, “Spring Day,” and another for “Not Today”.\n\nOn July 4, 2017, BTS released an official remake of Seo Taiji and the Boys' (서태지) classic song, \"Come Back Home\", as the start of Seo Taiji's 25th anniversary remake project called \"TIME: TRAVELER\". The group's remake of \"Come Back Home\" is the first official remake of the song since it's release in 1995. Rap Monster and J-Hope personally took part in writing the rap lyrics for it and a music video was released the next day for the special track.  \n\nIn August, 2017, BTS announced the beginning of their newest series, Love Yourself, by releasing a set of posters featuring the seven members of the group. Following the release of the posters, Big Hit released four videos that altogether makeup the \"LOVE YOURSELF Highlight Reel '起承轉結'\".

They are widely regarded as among the pioneers of hardcore punk, though the band's members objected to this term to describe their music. They are also an adept reggae band, while later recordings featured elements of other genres like funk, heavy metal, hip-hop and soul. Bad Brains are followers of the Rastafari movement.\n\nOriginally formed as a jazz fusion ensemble under the name Mind Power, Bad Brains developed a very fast and intense punk rock sound which came to be labeled \"hardcore\", and was often played faster and more emphatically than the music of many of their peers. The unique factor of the band's music was the fact that they played more complex rhythms than that of other hardcore punk bands, also adapting non-punk style guitar riffs and solos into their songs.\n\nBad Brains have released nine studio albums (one of which is entirely composed of instrumental versions of their past material). The band broke up and reformed several times over the years, sometimes with different singers or drummers. Since 1998, the lineup of singer H.R. (Human Rights), guitarist Dr. Know, bassist Darryl Jenifer, and drummer Earl Hudson has reunited, albeit performing sporadically.",

Powered by Rodgers' muscular vocals and Ralphs' blues-based guitar work, Bad Company was the first group signed to Led Zeppelin's Swan Song vanity label. Bad Company's eponymous 1974 debut was an international hit, topping the U.S. album charts and scoring with the number one single \"Can't Get Enough of Your Love.\" \n\nStraight Shooter, issued the following year, was another major success, notching the hit \"Feel Like Makin' Love,\" while 1976's Run With the Pack was Bad Company's third consecutive million-selling record. After 1977's Burnin' Sky, Bad Company recorded 1979's Desolation Angels, which embellished the group's sound with synthesizers and strings; a three-year hiatus followed before the release of Rough Diamonds, the group's final LP in its original incarnation. \n\nIn 1986, Ralphs and Kirke resurrected the Bad Company name, enlisting former Ted Nugent vocalist Brian Howe to replace Rodgers. The reconfigured unit's debut, Fame & Fortune, was a commercial failure, but 1988's Dangerous Age became a minor hit. Released in 1990, Holy Water fared even better, as the power ballad \"If You Needed Somebody\" became a Top 20 success. Here Comes Trouble, issued in 1992, achieved platinum status, and earned another Top 40 hit with \"How About That.\" On their 20th anniversary, Bad Company expanded into a quintet with the addition of bassist Rick Wills and rhythm guitarist Dave Colwell, and released the live retrospective The Best of Bad Company Live...What You Hear Is What You Get. \n\nTwo more LPs -- 1995's The Company of Strangers and the next year's Stories Told and Untold -- followed, and in 1998 the original lineup of Rodgers, Ralphs, Kirke, and Burrell reunited to record a handful of new tracks that surfaced alongside past material early the following year on The Original Bad Company Anthology. A reunion tour followed that spring.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Barry Manilow (born June 17, 1943) is an American singer-songwriter and producer. He is best known for such recordings as \"Could It Be Magic\", \"Mandy\", \"Can't Smile Without You\", and \"Copacabana (At the Copa).\"\n\nIn 1978, five of his albums were on the best-selling charts simultaneously, a feat equalled only by Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen and Johnny Mathis. He has recorded a string of Billboard hit singles and multi-platinum albums that have resulted in his being named Radio & Records number one Adult Contemporary artist and winning three straight American Music Awards for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist. Between 1974 - 1983 Manilow had three number 1 singles and 25 that reached the top 40. Several well-known entertainers have praised Manilow, including Sinatra, who was quoted in the 1970s saying, \"He's next.\" In 1988, Bob Dylan stopped Manilow at a party, hugged him and said, \"Don't stop what you're doing, man. We're all inspired by you.\"\n\nAs well as producing and arranging albums for other artists, including Bette Midler and Dionne Warwick, Manilow has written songs for musicals, films, and commercials. From February 2005 to December 30, 2009, he was the headliner at the Las Vegas Hilton, performing hundreds of shows before ending his relationship with the hotel. From March 2010, he has headlined at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas. He has sold more than 80 million records worldwide.\n\nManilow was born Barry Alan Pincus in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Harold Pincus and Edna Manilow. His mother's family was Jewish, while his father, who was often known by the surname \"Keliher,\" was born to a Jewish father and Irish American mother. Barry's name was changed to Barry Manilow at the time of his Bar Mitzvah, adopting his mother's maiden name. Reared in the community of Williamsburg in northern Brooklyn, Barry attended nearby Eastern District High School, from which he graduated in 1961. In the same year, he enrolled in the Juilliard performing arts school, while working at CBS to pay his expenses.\n\nAt CBS, in 1964, Manilow met Bro Herrod, a director, who asked him to arrange some songs for a musical adaptation of the melodrama, The Drunkard. Instead, Manilow wrote an entire original score. Herrod used his composition in the Off Broadway musical, which enjoyed an eight-year run at New York's 13th Street Theatre. Manilow then earned money by working as a pianist, producer, and arranger.\n\nDuring this time he began to work as a commercial jingle writer, an activity that continued well into the 1970s. Many of those he wrote and/or composed he would also perform, including State Farm Insurance (\"Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there...\"), and Band-Aid (\"I am stuck on Band-Aid, 'cause Band-Aid's stuck on me!\"), for which he adopted a surprisingly convincing child-like voice. His singing-only credits include Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pepsi, Dr Pepper, and the famed McDonald's \"You Deserve a Break Today\" campaign. Manilow won two Clio Awards in 1976 for his work for Tab and Band-Aid. These jingles were a mainstay of his concerts for years as his \"V.S.M.,\" or \"Very Strange Medley.\"\n\nBy 1967, Manilow was the musical director for the WCBS-TV series Callback, which premiered on January 27, 1968. He next conducted and arranged for Ed Sullivan's production company, arranging a new theme for The Late Show, while still writing, producing, and singing his radio and television jingles. At the same time, he and Jeanne Lucas performed as a duo for a two-season run at New York's Upstairs at the Downstairs club.(1968 / 1969)",

His influences include southern soul artists like Isaac Hayes, Clarence Carter, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin plus Motown artists The Supremes, The Four Tops and Marvin Gaye. Along with Isaac Hayes, White is considered by Allmusic.com as the first singer who played disco music before the actual period of the late 1970s.\n\nBarry White was born Barry Eugene Carter in Galveston, Texas, and grew up in the high-crime areas of South Central Los Angeles. White was the elder of two brothers; his brother Darryl is 13 months younger. He grew up listening to his mother's classical music collection, and first took to the piano emulating what he heard on the records. His introduction to music later led to him playing piano on Jesse Belvin's hit single, \"Goodnight My Love.\"\n\nWhite recalled that, \" I had a normal squeaky kid voice. Then as a teenager, that completely changed. My mother cried because she knew her baby boy had become a man.\"\n\nDuring his teenage years, White and his brother got involved with crime and gang activity. At age 17, he was jailed for four months for stealing $30,000 worth of Cadillac tires.\n\nWhite listened to Elvis Presley singing \"It's Now or Never\" on the radio, an experience he later credited with changing the course of his life.",

For the majority of its career, the group has consisted of three MCs and musicians Michael \"Mike D\" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam \"MCA\" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam \"Ad-Rock\" Horovitz (vocals, guitar).\nOriginally formed as a four-piece hardcore punk band in 1979 by Michael Diamond (vocals), John Berry (guitar), Adam Yauch (bass) and Kate Schellenbach (drums), the band appeared on the compilation cassette New York Thrash, before recording their first EP Polly Wog Stew, in 1982. After achieving moderate local success with the 1983 experimental hip hop 12-inch \"Cooky Puss\", the group transitioned to hip hop in 1984 and released a string of successful 12-inch singles. The Beastie Boys toured with Madonna in 1985 and a year later released their debut album Licensed to Ill. The group sold 22 million albums in the United States and 40 million albums worldwide, making them, according to Billboard, \"the biggest-selling rap group\" since 1991.\nWith seven platinum or better albums from 1986-2004, the Beastie Boys were one of the longest-lived hip hop acts worldwide, and they continued to enjoy commercial and critical success more than 25 years after Licensed to Ill.

It consists of three of New Edition's previous members, Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ronnie DeVoe.\nAfter closing the doors for 1980's R&B act New Edition, Bell, Bivins, and DeVoe went on to form Bell Biv Devoe, at the suggestion of producers Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. Upon accepting the idea, MCA records wrote down the name Bell Bivins Devoe, but Bivins suggested they remove the ins from his name and just call the group Bell Biv Devoe. With help from Public Enemy producers Eric Sadler, Hank and Keith Shocklee, and several others, Bell Biv Devoe released its debut album Poison in 1990, on MCA Records. The album was credited as pioneering the \"New Jack Swing\" sound of the early 1990s, combining hip-hop, funk, soul, and pop music. This fusion of styles helped to expose them to a fan base who prefer a harder edge sound, while at the same time helped pave the way for future R&B acts. Poison reached number 1 on Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop chart, and its title track, along with its second single, \"Do Me!\", both reached number 3 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Shortly thereafter, Richard Wolf and Epic Mazur were responsible for the remix of \"Do Me!\" (which hit Number One on the dance charts). Poison also spawned other significant hits which include \"B.B.D. (I Thought It Was Me)?\" \"When Will I See You Smile Again?\" and \"She's Dope!\" Poison sold over three million copies, and was followed up by a remix album titled WBBD-Bootcity. Richard Wolf and Epic Mazur helped create BBD's premiere album, blending rhythm, blues, pop, and rock, and Poison achieve triple Platinum success.",

She had released a solo album, Superpinkymandy, in 1993. Since the album was only released in Japan, it went largely unnoticed by international audiences. Her second solo album, Trailer Park, garnered much critical acclaim in 1996. Orton developed a devoted audience with the release of the albums Central Reservation (1999) and the 2002 UK top 10 album, Daybreaker. In her 2006 release, Comfort of Strangers, she moved towards a more folk-based sound and away from the electronic sound of her past albums.\n\nAmerican films and television programmes such as Felicity, How to Deal, Charmed, Dawson's Creek, Vanilla Sky and Grey's Anatomy have featured her music and provided her with exposure to a more mainstream American audience.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (born September 4, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer and actress. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\".\nFollowing the disbandment of Destiny's Child in June 2005, she released her second solo album, B'Day (2006), which contained hits \"Déjà Vu\", \"Irreplaceable\", and \"Beautiful Liar\". Beyoncé also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe-nominated performance in Dreamgirls (2006), and starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006) and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which saw the birth of her alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". Beyoncé took a hiatus from music in 2010 and took over management of her career; her fourth album 4 (2011) was subsequently mellower in tone, exploring 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul. Her critically acclaimed fifth studio album, Beyoncé (2013), was distinguished from previous releases by its experimental production and exploration of darker themes.  With the release of Lemonade (2016), Beyoncé became the first artist to have their first six studio albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart.\nA self-described \"modern-day feminist\", Beyoncé creates songs that are often characterized by themes of love, relationships, and monogamy, as well as female sexuality and empowerment. On stage, her dynamic, highly choreographed performances have led to critics hailing her as one of the best entertainers in contemporary popular music. Throughout a career spanning 19 years, she has sold over 118 million records as a solo artist, and a further 60 million with Destiny's Child, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. She has won 20 Grammy Awards and is the most nominated woman in the award's history. The Recording Industry Association of America recognized her as the Top Certified Artist in America during the 2000s decade. In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade, the Top Female Artist of the 2000s and their Artist of the Millennium in 2011. Time listed her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013 and 2014. Forbes magazine also listed her as the most powerful female musician of 2015.",

He first appeared on albums from The Beatnuts, on the track \"Off the Books\" in 1997, and on Fat Joe's second album Jealous One's Envy in 1995, on the track \"Watch Out\", prior to signing to Loud Records as a solo artist. Pun's lyrics are notable for technical efficiency, having minimal pauses to take a breath, heavy use of alliteration as well as internal and multi-syllabic rhyming schemes. He died from a heart attack at age 28.\n\nAbout.com ranked him #25 on its list of the 50 Greatest MCs of Our Time (1987–2007), while MTV2 ranked him #11 on its list of the \"22 Greatest MCs.\" In 2012, The Source ranked him #19 on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time.

Since releasing his first hit song, \"Piano Man\", in 1973, Joel has become the sixth-best-selling recording artist and the third-best-selling solo artist in the United States, according to the RIAA. His compilation album Greatest Hits Vol. 1 & 2 is the third-best-selling album in the United States by discs shipped.\nJoel had Top 40 hits in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, achieving 33 Top 40 hits in the United States, all of which he wrote himself. He is also a six-time Grammy Award winner, a 23-time Grammy nominee and one of the world's best-selling artists of all time, having sold over 150 million records worldwide. He was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame (1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1999), and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (2006). In 2008, Billboard magazine released a list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary, with Billy Joel positioned at No. 23. With the exception of the 2007 songs \"All My Life\" and \"Christmas in Fallujah\", Joel stopped writing and recording popular music after 1993's River of Dreams, but he continued to tour extensively until 2010. Joel was born in the Bronx, May 9, 1949 and raised in Hicksville, New York in a Levitt home. His father, Howard (born Helmuth), was born in Germany, the son of German merchant and manufacturer Karl Amson Joel, who, after the advent of the Nazi regime, emigrated to Switzerland and later to the United States. Billy Joel's mother, Rosalind Nyman, was born in England to Philip and Rebecca Nyman. Both of Joel's parents were Jewish. They divorced in 1960, and his father moved to Vienna, Austria. Billy has a sister, Judith Joel, and a half-brother, Alexander Joel, who is an acclaimed classical conductor in Europe and currently chief musical director of the Staatstheater Braunschweig.\nJoel's father was an accomplished classical pianist. Billy reluctantly began piano lessons at an early age, at his mother's insistence; his teachers included the noted American pianist Morton Estrin and musician/songwriter Timothy Ford. His interest in music, rather than sports, was a source of teasing and bullying in his early years. (He has said in interviews that his piano instructor also taught ballet. Her name was Frances Neiman, and she was a Juilliard trained musician. She gave both classical piano and ballet lessons in the studio attached to the rear of her house, leading neighborhood bullies to mistakenly assume that he was learning to dance.) As a teenager, Joel took up boxing so that he would be able to defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit for a short time, winning twenty-two bouts, but abandoned the sport shortly after breaking his nose in his twenty-fourth boxing match.\nJoel attended Hicksville High School in 1967, but he did not graduate with his class. He had been helping his single mother make ends meet by playing at a piano bar, which interfered with his school attendance. At the end of his senior year, Joel did not have enough credits to graduate. Rather than attend summer school to earn his diploma, however, Joel decided to immediately begin a career in music. Joel recounted, \"I told them, 'To hell with it. If I'm not going to Columbia University, I'm going to Columbia Records, and you don't need a high school diploma over there'.\" Columbia did, in fact, become the label that eventually signed him. In 1992, he submitted essays to the school board and was awarded his diploma at Hicksville High's annual graduation ceremony, 25 years after he had left.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Harry Lillis \"Bing\" Crosby (May 3, 1903 – October 14, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Crosby's trademark bass-baritone voice made him one of the best-selling recording artists of the 20th century, with over half a billion records in circulation.\nA multimedia star, from 1934 to 1954 Bing Crosby was a leader in record sales, radio ratings and motion picture grosses. His early career coincided with technical recording innovations; this allowed him to develop a laid-back, intimate singing style that influenced many of the popular male singers who followed him, including Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, and Dean Martin. Yank magazine recognized Crosby as the person who had done the most for American G.I. morale during World War II and, during his peak years, around 1948, polls declared him the \"most admired man alive,\" ahead of Jackie Robinson and Pope Pius XII. Also in 1948, the Music Digest estimated that Crosby recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music.\nCrosby exerted an important influence on the development of the postwar recording industry. He worked for NBC at the time and wanted to record his shows; however, most broadcast networks did not allow recording. This was primarily because the quality of recording at the time was not as good as live broadcast sound quality. While in Europe performing during the war, Crosby had witnessed tape recording, on which The Crosby Research Foundation would come to have many patents. The company also developed equipment and recording techniques such as the Laugh Track which are still in use today. In 1947, he invested $50,000 in the Ampex company, which built North America's first commercial reel-to-reel tape recorder. He left NBC to work for ABC because NBC was not interested in recording at the time. This proved beneficial because ABC accepted him and his new ideas. Crosby then became the first performer to pre-record his radio shows and master his commercial recordings onto magnetic tape. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 200 recorders to his friend, musician Les Paul, which led directly to Paul's invention of multitrack recording. Along with Frank Sinatra, Crosby was one of the principal backers behind the famous United Western Recorders recording studio complex in Los Angeles.\nDuring the \"Golden Age of Radio,\" performers often had to recreate their live shows a second time for the west coast time zone. Through the medium of recording, Crosby constructed his radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, time shifting) being used in motion picture production. This became the industry standard.\nCrosby won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Father Chuck O'Malley in the 1944 motion picture Going My Way, and was nominated for his reprise of the role in The Bells of St. Mary's the next year, becoming the first of four actors to be nominated twice for playing the same character. In 1963, Crosby received the first Grammy Global Achievement Award. Crosby is one of the 22 people to have three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (a star for Motion Pictures, Radio, and Audio Recording).\nIn 1983, six years after Crosby's death, son Gary Crosby published his autobiography, Going My Own Way, which revealed the effect of his alcoholism and difficult childhood as a result of his mother's alcoholism and his father's alleged emotional and physical abuse. Some, especially his brother Phillip, claimed the abuse did not take place and that Gary's tellings were instead exaggerated accounts of corporal punishment.  Despite the opposing viewpoints, the book damaged for some Bing Crosby's image as an ideal, low-keyed father.",

However, they disbanded in December 1994 after having released only one album. Wylde subsequently recorded an acoustic solo album, Book of Shadows (released 1996). In May 1998, after limited commercial success with Book of Shadows, Wylde and drummer Phil Ondich recorded what became Black Label Society's debut album Sonic Brew. It was decided, rather than the album being another solo album for Wylde, that they would form a long term band. It was known from the start that Nick Catanese would be retained as the second guitarist in the band (Catanese previously toured as rhythm guitarist for the Book Of Shadows tour). John DeServio, who previously worked with Wylde as a temporary replacement in Pride & Glory, joined as the band's bassist for the album's tour.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Black Sabbath are an English rock band, formed in Aston, Birmingham in 1969 by Ozzy Osbourne (lead vocals), Tony Iommi (guitar), Geezer Butler (bass guitar), and Bill Ward (drums). The band has since experienced multiple line-up changes, with Tony Iommi the only constant presence in the band through the years. Originally formed in 1968 as a heavy blues rock band named Earth and renamed Black Sabbath in 1969, the band began incorporating occult and horror-inspired lyrics with tuned-down guitars and achieving multiple platinum records in the 1970s. Despite an association with occult and horror themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability, political corruption, the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophesies of the horrors of war.\nBlack Sabbath are cited as pioneers of heavy metal. The band helped define the genre with releases such as quadruple-platinum Paranoid, released in 1970. They were ranked by MTV as the \"Greatest Metal Band\" of all time, and placed second in VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" list, behind Led Zeppelin. Rolling Stone called the band \"the heavy-metal kings of the '70s\". They have sold over 15 million records in the United States and over 70 million records worldwide. Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, and were included among Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\nVocalist Ozzy Osbourne's heavy alcohol and drug usage led to him being fired from the band in April 1979, after which he began a successful solo career, selling over 55 million albums. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. After a few albums with Dio's vocals and songwriting collaborations, Black Sabbath endured a revolving line-up in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin. In 1992, Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer Vinny Appice to record Dehumanizer. The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album Reunion. The line-up featuring Iommi, Butler, Dio, and Appice reformed in 2006 under the moniker Heaven & Hell until Dio's death on 16 May 2010.\nOn 11 November 2011, the original band members announced that they were reuniting and recording a new album. The band performed a headlining slot at the Download Festival on 10 June 2012, with a world tour scheduled to follow. On 2 February 2012, Ward announced that he would not participate in the Black Sabbath reunion unless he was given a \"signable contract.\" The following day, the other group members announced they had \"no choice but to continue recording without him,\" but said \"our door is always open\" for Ward to return to the band.",

Taliaferro who had Chauncey Hannibal and Levon Little, both Paterson, New Jersey natives,under production and management contracts, suggested them as vocalists and Riley had Joseph Stonestreet, a Cincinnati, Ohio, native, who Riley met while both were on the west coast in Los Angeles through mutual friends. Originally, the group was to be named Stonestreet, but during a meeting with Taliaferro and Riley's younger brother Markell (Wreckx-n-Effects) Taliaferro suggested to use part of Stonestreet's last name and Chauncey's nickname \"Black\" as a symbol of Urban life, like the Black tar of the street in the \"hood\". Riley agreed and the group became Blackstreet Feat. Teddy Riley. The original members of Blackstreet were Teddy Riley, Chauncey Black, Levi Little, and Joseph Stonestreet. Stonestreet was replaced, however, by Dave Hollister before their first self-entitled album was released. As of 2013, the current members are Teddy Riley, Dave Hollister, Sherman \"J-Stylz\" Tinsdale, Glenn Adams (aka Lenny Harold), and Monte Mitchell (aka Tony Tyler), and is now known as Bs2 as they cannot completely use the Blackstreet moniker since Hannibal owns the name. The group is noted for doing the dance move, \"The Lean,\" at concerts.",

Their first two albums contained strong elements of these genres, and although successful in the United Kingdom and Australia, Blondie was regarded as an underground band in the United States until the release of Parallel Lines in 1978.\nOver the next three years, the band achieved several hit singles including \"Call Me\", \"Atomic\" and \"Heart of Glass\" and became noted for its eclectic mix of musical styles incorporating elements of disco, pop, rap, and reggae, while retaining a basic style as a New Wave band.\nBlondie broke up after the release of their sixth studio album The Hunter in 1982. Deborah Harry continued to pursue a solo career with varied results after taking a few years off to care for partner Chris Stein, who was diagnosed with pemphigus, a rare autoimmune disease of the skin.\nThe band reformed in 1997, achieving renewed success and a number one single in the United Kingdom with \"Maria\" in 1999. The group toured and performed throughout the world during the following years, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Blondie has sold 40 million records worldwide and is still active today. Their ninth studio album, Panic of Girls, was released in 2011.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Spanning three decades, Blue Öyster Cult has a long and interesting history. The band got its start in the late '60s on Long Island, New York, as the Soft White Underbelly, before ending up in the \"right place at the right time\" to create the beginnings of Blue Öyster Cult.\nLong Island native Donald Roeser and Albert Bouchard (of Watertown, New York) met at Clarkson College, in Potsdam, NY. The two were introduced by a mutual friend, Bruce Abbott (who later co-authored \"Golden Age of Leather\" with Donald). With Abbott and two other friends, they formed \"The Disciples\" and played college parties and local beer halls. The next year, the band reformed and played the same circuits as \"Travesty\" (named after the Blues Project album). Through all this, their studies fell by the wayside, and both Albert and Donald decided to quit college to concentrate on playing music full-time.\nEventually \"Travesty\" broke up and Donald and Albert paths separated for a while. Donald met Sandy Pearlman, a pioneering voice of rock criticism, who with his friend, Richard Meltzer, were contributors to the seminal magazine \"Crawdaddy!,\" the first magazine dedicated to the analysis of rock music and its culture.\nAllen Lanier then came into the fold by way of guitarist John Wiesenthal. An old house near Stony Brook College became ground zero for the formative band, and casual jams with whomever happened to be hanging around began to turn into rehearsals with a core band, which included Wiesenthal, Donald, Albert, Allen and Andrew Winters, a school friend of Donald. It was 1967.\nIn 1970, the band's name was changed to the Blue Oyster Cult, a name suggested by Richard Meltzer to Sandy Pearlman. The name comes from the famous Long Island \"Blue Point Oysters.\"  The umlaut was added later which started the trend for using the \"heavy metal umlaut\" in band names.\nAt a time when the heavy metal was starting to seem tired, Blue Öyster Cult released records that combined powerful music and intelligent and funny lyrics. A steady flow of albums with great songs, like \"Burnin' for You\", \"Godzilla\", \"The Red And The Black\", \"This Ain't The Summer of Love\", \"Astronomy\", \"Black Blade\", \"Flaming Telepaths\", and \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\".\nIn 1998, the BÖC released Heaven Forbid, to fine reviews, particularly of the track, \"Harvest Moon\".  Curse of the Hidden Mirror followed in 2001.\nTheir motto \"On Tour Forever\" still holds, as the band plays over 100 dates per year.",

Formed in London in 1988 as Seymour, the group consists of singer/keyboardist Damon Albarn, guitarist/singer Graham Coxon, bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree. Blur's debut album Leisure (1991) incorporated the sounds of Madchester and shoegazing. Following a stylistic change influenced by English guitar pop groups such as The Kinks, The Beatles and XTC, Blur released Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). As a result, the band helped to popularise the Britpop genre and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a chart battle with rival band Oasis in 1995 dubbed \"The Battle of Britpop\".\nIn recording their follow-up, Blur (1997), the band underwent another reinvention, showing influence from the lo-fi style of American indie rock groups. \"Song 2\", one of the album's singles, brought Blur mainstream success in the United States. Their next album, 13 (1999) saw the band members experimenting with electronic and gospel music, and featured more personal lyrics from Albarn. In May 2002, Coxon left Blur during the recording of their seventh album Think Tank (2003). Containing electronic sounds and more minimal guitar work, the album was marked by Albarn's growing interest in hip hop and African music. After a 2003 tour without Coxon, Blur did no studio work or touring as a band, as members engaged in other projects. In 2008 Blur reunited, with Coxon back in the fold, for a series of concerts and have continued to release several singles and retrospective releases. In 2012, Blur received a Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman on 24  May 1941, Duluth, Minnesota, USA) is an American singer-songwriter, musician and artist. He has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for five decades. Zimmerman changed his surname to Dylan in homage to the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, who had frequented the streets and bars of New York's Greenwich Village a generation earlier. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when he was an informal chronicler and a seemingly reluctant figurehead of social unrest. A number of Dylan's early songs, such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\", became anthems for the US civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving his initial base in the culture of folk music behind, Dylan's six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" has been described as radically altering the parameters of popular music in 1965. His recordings employing electric instruments attracted denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.\n\nDylan's lyrics incorporated a variety of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed hugely to the then burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the songs of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, and the music and performance styles of Buddy Holly, Little Richard and Elvis Presley, Dylan has both amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning fifty years, has explored numerous distinct traditions in American song-from folk, blues and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and swing.\n\nDylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is generally considered to be his songwriting.\n\nSince 1994, Dylan has published three books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. As a songwriter and musician, Dylan has received numerous awards over the years including Grammy, Golden Globe, and Academy Awards; he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\" In May 2012, Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Robert Nesta \"Bob\" Marley, OM (6 February 1945 - 11 May 1981) was a Jamaican singer-songwriter and musician. He was the rhythm guitarist and lead singer for the ska, rocksteady and reggae band Bob Marley & The Wailers (1963-1981). Marley remains the most widely known and revered performer of reggae music, and is credited with helping spread both Jamaican music and the Rastafari movement to a worldwide audience.\n\nMarley's music was heavily influenced by the social issues of his homeland, and he is considered to have given voice to the specific political and cultural nexus of Jamaica. His best-known hits include \"I Shot the Sheriff\", \"No Woman, No Cry\", \"Could You Be Loved\", \"Stir It Up\", \"Get Up Stand Up\", \"Jamming\", \"Redemption Song\", \"One Love\" and, \"Three Little Birds\", as well as the posthumous releases \"Buffalo Soldier\" and \"Iron Lion Zion\". The compilation album Legend (1984), released three years after his death, is reggae's best-selling album, going ten times Platinum which is also known as one Diamond in the U.S., and selling 25 million copies worldwide.\n\nBob Marley was born in the village of Nine Mile in Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica as Nesta Robert Marley. A Jamaican passport official would later swap his first and middle names. His father, Norval Sinclair Marley, was a white Jamaican of mixed and English descent whose family came from Sussex, England. Norval was a captain in the Royal Marines, as well as a plantation overseer, when he married Cedella Booker, an Afro-Jamaican then 18 years old. Norval provided financial support for his wife and child, but seldom saw them, as he was often away on trips. In 1955, when Bob Marley was 10 years old, his father died of a heart attack at age 70. Marley faced questions about his own racial identity throughout his life. He once reflected:\n\nI don't have prejudice against meself. My father was a white and my mother was black. Them call me half-caste or whatever. Me don't deh pon nobody's side. Me don't deh pon the black man's side nor the white man's side. Me deh pon God's side, the one who create me and cause me to come from black and white.\n\nAlthough Marley recognised his mixed ancestry, throughout his life and because of his beliefs, he self-identified as a black African, following the ideas of Pan-African leaders. Marley stated that his two biggest influences were the African-centered Marcus Garvey and Haile Selassie. A central theme in Bob Marley's message was the repatriation of black people to Zion, which in his view was Ethiopia, or more generally, Africa. In songs such as \"Black Survivor\", \"Babylon System\", and \"Blackman Redemption\", Marley sings about the struggles of blacks and Africans against oppression from the West or \"Babylon\".\n\nMarley and his step brother Bunny Wailer (Bob's mother had a daughter with Bunny's father, younger sister to both of them) started to play music while he was still at school, which he left at the age of 14 to make music with Joe Higgs, a local singer and devout Rastafari. At a jam session with Higgs and Livingston, Marley met Peter McIntosh (later known as Peter Tosh), who had similar musical ambitions. In 1962, Marley recorded his first two singles, \"Judge Not\" and \"One Cup of Coffee\", with local music producer Leslie Kong. These songs, released on the Beverley's label under the pseudonym of Bobby Martell, attracted little attention. The songs were later re-released on the box set Songs of Freedom, a posthumous collection of Marley's work. Marley was also known to use an Epiphone guitar for much of his career.",

However, he is widely respected for being a multi-talented, versatile performer.\n\nBobby Darin was a very special and talented entertainer. He was a Grammy award winning singer (‘Mack The Knife’), a respected member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (‘Dream Lover’, ‘Splish Splash’, ‘If I Were A Carpenter’) a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, a successful record producer, an Oscar nominated actor and a strong supporter of the American Heart Association. Bobby was married to actress Sandra Dee from 1960-1967. They had one son, Dodd, born in Dec. 1961. As a result of complications from a rheumatic heart, Bobby’s life was tragically cut short in 1973.\n\nBobby Darin was raised by his mother and sister who actually turned out to be his grandmother and his mother (when his mother had him they moved away and said he was the grandmother’s baby because his mother was so young at the time people would have shunned her from society)\n\nFor more on Bobby Darin, watch “Beyond the Sea,” in which Kevin Spacey portrays the entertainer.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Bon Jovi is an American rock band from Sayreville, New Jersey. Formed in 1983, Bon Jovi consists of lead singer and namesake Jon Bon Jovi (John Francis Bongiovi, Jr.), guitarist Richie Sambora, keyboardist David Bryan, drummer Tico Torres, as well as current bassist Hugh McDonald. The band's lineup has remained mostly static during their history, the only exception being the departure of Alec John Such in 1994, who was unofficially replaced by Hugh McDonald. The band became known for writing several rock anthems and achieved widespread recognition with their third album, Slippery When Wet, released in 1986. After touring and recording non-stop during the late 1980s, the band went on hiatus after the New Jersey Tour in 1990, during which time Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora both released successful solo albums. In 1992, the band returned with the album Keep the Faith. Their 2000 single \"It's My Life\", which followed a second hiatus, successfully introduced the band to a younger audience. Bon Jovi has been known to use different styles in their music, which has included country for their 2007 album Lost Highway. Their latest album, The Circle, was released on November 10, 2009 in the United States.\nThroughout their career, the band have released eleven studio albums, three compilation albums and one live album, and have sold 130 million records worldwide. They have performed more than 2,600 concerts in over 50 countries for more than 34 million fans, and were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006. The band was also honored with the Award of Merit at the American Music Awards in 2004. Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora were inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009.\nJon Bon Jovi began playing piano and guitar in 1975, at the age of 13, with his first band 'Raze'. At 16, Bon Jovi met David Bryan and formed a band called Atlantic City Expressway. Still in his teens, Bon Jovi played in the band \"John Bongiovi and the Wild Ones,\" playing local clubs like \"The Fast Lane,\" and opening for known acts in the area. By 1980, he formed another band, \"The Rest\", and opened up for New Jersey acts such as Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.\nBy mid-1982, out of school and working part-time at a women's shoe store, Jon Bon Jovi took a job at the Power Station Studios, a Manhattan recording facility where his cousin Tony Bongiovi was co-owner. Bon Jovi made several demos-including one produced by Billy Squier-and sent them to record companies, though failing to make an impact. His first professional recording was as lead vocals in \"R2-D2 We Wish You a Merry Christmas,\" which was part of the Christmas in the Stars album which his cousin co-produced.\nBon Jovi visited local radio station WAPP 103.5FM \"The Apple\" in Lake Success, New York. He spoke directly to the promotion director, John Lassman, who accepted the song \"Runaway\" for inclusion on the station's compilation album of local homegrown talent. Bon Jovi was initially reluctant, but eventually gave them the song, on which Bon Jovi had used studio musicians to play on the track. The studio musicians who helped record \"Runaway\"-known as The All Star Review-were guitarist Tim Pierce, keyboardist Roy Bittan, drummer Frankie LaRocka, and bassist Hugh McDonald.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Bonnie Lynn Raitt (born November 8, 1949) is an American blues singer-songwriter and slide guitar player. During the 1970s, Raitt released a series of acclaimed roots-influenced albums which incorporated elements of blues, rock, folk and country, but she is perhaps best known for her more commercially accessible recordings in the 1990s including \"Nick of Time\", \"Something to Talk About\", \"Love Sneakin' Up on You\", and the slow ballad \"I Can't Make You Love Me\". Raitt has received nine Grammy Awards in her career and is a lifelong political activist.\nRaitt, the daughter of Broadway musical star John Raitt and his first wife, pianist Marjorie Haydock, began playing guitar at an early age, something few of her high school female friends did. Later she would become famous for her bottleneck-style guitar playing. \"I had played a little at school and at camp\", she later recalled in a July 2002 interview. The camp Raitt refers to is Camp Regis-Applejack, located on Upper St. Regis Lake in New York.\nAfter graduating from Oakwood Friends School in Poughkeepsie, New York, in 1967 Raitt entered Radcliffe College as a freshman, majoring in social relations and African studies. \"My plan was to travel to Tanzania, where President Julius Nyerere was creating a government based on democracy and socialism\", Raitt recalled. \"I wanted to help undo the damage that Western colonialism had done to native cultures around the world. Cambridge, Massachusetts was a hotbed of this kind of thinking, and I was thrilled.\"\nOne day, Raitt was told by a friend that blues promoter Dick Waterman was giving an interview at WHRB, Harvard's college radio station. An important figure in the blues revival of the 1960s, Waterman was also a Cambridge resident. Raitt went to see Waterman, and the two soon became friends, \"much to the chagrin of my parents, who didn't expect their freshman daughter to be running around with 65-year-old bluesmen,\" recalled Raitt. \"I was amazed by his passion for the music and the integrity with which he managed the musicians.\"\nDuring Raitt's sophomore year, Waterman relocated to Philadelphia, and a number of local musicians he counted among his friends went with him. Raitt had become a strong part of that community, recalling that \"... these people had become my friends, my mentors, and though I had every intention of graduating, I decided to take the semester off and move to Philadelphia .... It was an opportunity that young white girls just don't get, and as it turns out, an opportunity that changed everything.\"\nBy now, Raitt was also playing folk and rhythm and blues clubs in the Boston area, performing alongside established blues legends such as Howlin' Wolf, Sippie Wallace, and Mississippi Fred McDowell, all of whom she met through Waterman.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Before her well-known collaborations with Meat Loaf producer Jim Steinman, Welsh-born singer Bonnie Tyler (born Gaynor Hopkins) performed off and on in her homeland with the R&B band Mumbles; nodules on her vocal cords prevented her from singing full-time until 1976, when she underwent an operation to have them removed. The surgery left her with a raspy, husky voice that proved an effective instrument and drew notice from writer/producers Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe, who became her managers. Tyler scored a number three hit with their \"It's a Heartache\" in 1978, but became dissatisfied as the two attempted to steer her into country music. When her contract ran out, she signed with CBS and sought Steinman out, hoping for material with his trademark epic sound. She got it with the ballad \"Total Eclipse of the Heart,\" which was recorded with E Street Band members Max Weinberg on drums and Roy Bittan on keyboards, plus guitarist Rick Derringer and backing vocalist Rory Dodd. The song spent four weeks at number one on the Billboard charts and helped the LP Faster Than the Speed of Night sell over a million copies and debut at number one in the U.K., where the title track also became a hit. Tyler then recorded \"Holding Out for a Hero\" for the blockbuster Footloose soundtrack, which to date has remained her last major success. She went on to work with Todd Rundgren and Desmond Child and recorded the European hit album Bitterblue in 1991 for a German label, which featured contributions from Nik Kershaw, Harold Faltermeyer, and Giorgio Moroder. In 1996, she released Free Spirit on Atlantic Records to little attention.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Boyz II Men is an American R&B vocal group best known for emotional ballads and a cappella harmonies. They are the most successful R&B group of all time, having sold more than 60 million albums worldwide. Currently the group is a trio, featuring baritone Nathan Morris alongside tenors Wanya Morris and Shawn Stockman. In the 1990s, Boyz II Men found fame on Motown Records as a quartet, but the original member and bass singer Michael McCary left the group in 2003 due to health issues. The quartet won four Grammy Awards, and the trio was nominated for two Grammys in 2009.\nIn the 1990s, Boyz II Men gained international celebrity behind unprecedented success on the pop charts. The group's first single to reach Number 1, 1992's \"End of the Road\", a phenomenal hit, reached the top of charts across the globe. \"End of the Road\" would set a new record for longevity, staying at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 13 weeks, breaking a decades-old record held by Elvis Presley. Boyz II Men would exceed even that record later in the decade with hits \"I'll Make Love to You\" and \"One Sweet Day\" (with Mariah Carey), which each set new records for the longest period of time a single remained at number 1. As of 2012, \"One Sweet Day\" still holds the all-time record with 16 weeks at the top of the Hot 100. In short, Boyz II Men ranks at the top of the list three times - at the number one, three, and four spots - for the longest running Number 1 singles in Billboard history. Furthermore, when \"On Bended Knee\" took the number 1 spot away from \"I'll Make Love To You,\" Boyz II Men became only the third artist ever (after The Beatles and Elvis) to replace themselves at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. Boyz II Men are among a select group of artists that have held at the number one spot for at least 50 weeks cumulatively, placing them just fourth on that list behind Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Mariah Carey. These achievements were enough to earn Boyz II Men recognition as Billboard Magazineâ€²s fourth most successful musical group of the 1990s.\nBoyz II Men continues to perform in concert to audiences around the world. Their most recent studio album, Twenty, was released in 2011.",

Born in McComb, Mississippi, and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, Spears began performing as a child, landing acting roles in stage productions and television shows. She signed with Jive Records in 1997 and released her debut album ...Baby One More Time in 1999, which became the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist. During her first decade in the music industry, she became a prominent figure in mainstream popular music and popular culture, followed by a much-publicized personal life. Her first two albums established her as a pop icon and broke sales records, while title tracks \"...Baby One More Time\" and \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" became international number-one hits. Spears was credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s, and became the 'best-selling teenaged artist of all time' before she turned 20, garnering her the honorific titles of \"Princess of Pop\" and \"Queen of Pop\".\nIn 2001, she released her third studio album Britney and expanded her brand, playing the starring role in the film Crossroads. She assumed creative control of her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003), which yielded chart-topping singles \"Me Against the Music\", \"Toxic\" and \"Everytime\". After the release of two compilation albums, Spears experienced personal struggles and her career went into hiatus. Her fifth studio album, Blackout, was released in 2007 and despite receiving little promotion, it spawned hits \"Gimme More\" and \"Piece of Me\". In 2008, her erratic behavior and hospitalizations caused her to be placed in a conservatorship. The same year, her sixth studio album Circus was released, with the global chart-topping lead single \"Womanizer\", and hits such as \"Circus\" and \"If U Seek Amy\". She embarked on her highest-grossing global concert tour, The Circus Starring Britney Spears, in 2009. In October of the same year, she released a chart-topping single, \"3\", which became her third single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Her seventh studio album Femme Fatale, released in 2011, has become the first of her albums to yield three top ten singles in the United States, \"Hold It Against Me\", \"Till the World Ends\" and \"I Wanna Go\". The same year, she also gained her fifth number one single when she featured on the remix of \"S&M\" alongside Rihanna.\nSpears's work has earned her numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award, 6 MTV Video Music Awards including the Lifetime Achievement Award, 9 Billboard Music Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2009, Billboard ranked her as the 8th overall Artist of the Decade, and also recognized her as the best-selling female artist of the first decade of the 21st century, as well as the fifth overall. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) also recognized Spears as the eighth top-selling female artist in the United States, with 33 million certified albums. Nielsen SoundScan ranked Spears the tenth best-selling digital artist of the country, with more than 28.6 million digital singles as of January 2012. She has sold over 100 million albums worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Rolling Stone recognized her instant success as one of the Top 25 Teen Idol Breakout Moments of all time, while VH1 ranked her eleventh on their \"100 Greatest Women in Music\" list in 2012, and Billboard named her the sexiest woman in music.

They also had some success with the singles “Grapevyne”, and “I Can’t Tell You Why”, a song originally recorded by the Eagles.\n\nThe three original members of Brownstone were Nicole “Nicci” Gilbert, Charmayne “Maxee” Maxwell and Monica “Mimi” Doby. The group was founded in Los Angeles after the three singers met each other after going to different auditions around the city. They formed the group, and less than a year later were signed to Michael Jackson’s MJJ Music Record Label. They recorded their debut album, From the Bottom Up which spawned the hit “If You Love Me”. In 1995 the band was rewarded with a Grammy nomination and a Billboard Music Award.\n\nAfter extensive touring around the globe, Doby left the group after what was released in the media. In an interview with BET Video Soul host Donnie Simpson Doby cited a medical problem of bronchitis, but was later revealed to be because of internal strife with the other two members of the group. She was replaced by Kina Cosper and after a difficult transition period where their audience was not very receptive to the change, Brownstone had a brief showing with “5 Miles to Empty”. However, the group never regained their popularity, and their subsequent albums were considered commercial failures. ",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Apart from the Byrds, no other American band had as great an impact on folk-rock and country-rock -- really, the entire Californian rock sound -- than Buffalo Springfield. The group's formation is the stuff of legend: driving on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, Stephen Stills and Richie Furay spotted a hearse that Stills was sure belonged to Neil Young, a Canadian he had crossed paths with earlier. Indeed it was, and with the addition of fellow hearse passenger and Canadian Bruce Palmer on bass and ex-Dillard Dewey Martin on drums, the cluster of ex-folkys determined, as the Byrds had just done, to become a rock & roll band.\nBuffalo Springfield\nBuffalo Springfield wasn't together long -- they were an active outfit for just over two years, between 1967 and 1968 --but every one of their three albums was noteworthy. Their debut, Buffalo Springfield, including their sole big hit (Stills' \"For What It's Worth\"), established them as the best folk-rock band in the land barring the Byrds, though Springfield was a bit more folk and country oriented. Again, their second album found the group expanding their folk-rock base into tough hard rock and psychedelic orchestration, resulting in their best record. The group was blessed with three idiosyncratic, talented songwriters in Stills, Young, and Furay (the last of whom didn't begin writing until the second LP) yet they also had strong and often conflicting egos, particularly Stills and Young. The group, who held almost infinite promise, rearranged their lineup several times, Young leaving the group for periods and Palmer fighting deportation, until disbanding in 1968. Their final album clearly shows the group fragmenting into solo directions.\nEventually, the inter-personal tensions and creative battles led to a perhaps inevitable split, starting with Young's departure for a solo career. He would later reunite with Stephen Stills in Crosby, Stills, & Nash, joining the trio once a decade for various projects. In addition to CSN, Stills released solo albums and worked with a nother band, Manassas. Initially, Jim Messina and Richie Furay stayed together, forming the country-rock group Poco, but Messina left after three albums to team up in a duo with Kenny Loggins. Furay himself left Poco and teamed with Chris Hillman and JD Souther in the Souther Hillman Furay Band before pursuing a solo career. Rumors of a Buffalo Springfield reunion circulated for years -- Young even hinted at it with the song \"Buffalo Springfield Again\" --and it finally happened in the fall of 2010. Young, Furay and Stills reunited as Buffalo Springfield for a pair of shows at Young's annual Bridge School Benefit in the fall of 2010. It wasn't a complete reunion, since Palmer had died in 2004 and Martin passed in 2009, but the three singers used bassist Rick Rosas and drummer Joe Vitale to fill in. The same configuration played six concerts in the spring of 2011, but reportedly did no studio work.",

Drummers such as Sacha Gervasi, Amir, and Spencer Cobrin had all filled in as Bush drummers before Robin Goodridge was made the permanent fit and thus completing the Bush lineup.\n\nThe band found immediate success with the release of their debut album Sixteen Stone in 1994, which is certified 6Ã— multi-platinum by the RIAA. Bush went on to become one of the most commercially successful rock bands of the 1990s, selling over 10 million records in the United States. Despite their success in the United States, the band was less well known in their home country and enjoyed only marginal success there. Bush have had numerous top ten singles on the Billboard rock charts, and one No. 1 album for Razorblade Suitcase in 1996. The band separated in 2002 but the name was revived in 2010 and they began work on a new album, The Sea of Memories, which was released in September 2011.\n\nThe group chose the name \"Bush\" because they used to live in Shepherd's Bush, London.\n\nIn Canada, they were once known as Bushx, because the 1970s band Bush, led by Domenic Troiano, owned the Canadian rights to the name. In April 1997, it was announced that Troiano had agreed to let them use the name Bush in Canada without the exponent x, in exchange for donating $20,000 each to the Starlight Children's Foundation and the Canadian Music Therapy Trust Fund.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Belcalis Almanzar (born October 11, 1992), known professionally as Cardi B, is an American hip hop recording artist, and a television and social media personality. Born and raised in the Bronx borough of New York City, she first attracted attention for discussing her career as a stripper on social media; coupled with her \"no filter attitude\", she became an Internet celebrity through Instagram. From 2015 to 2017, she appeared as a regular cast member on the VH1 reality television series Love & Hip Hop: New York. In February 2017, she signed her first major label record deal with Atlantic Records. Her debut single for Atlantic, titled \"Bodak Yellow\", reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, with the New York Times calling it \"the rap anthem of the summer\".\n\nEarly life\nCardi B was born on October 11, 1992, to a Trinidadian mother and Dominican father. She was raised in the Highbridge neighborhood located in the South Bronx section of New York City. Growing up she spent a lot of time at her grandmother's place in Washington Heights, Manhattan, to which she credits having \"such a thick accent\".\n\nAs a youth, Cardi B was a member of the Bloods street gang, claiming to have been a gangbanger since the age of 16. She went on to attend Renaissance High School For Musical Theater & Technology, a small specialty school on the Herbert H. Lehman campus. During her teenage years, she was employed at an Amish Market supermarket in Lower Manhattan, which was the last job that she held before turning to stripping at the age of 19. Upon being fired from Amish Market, her former manager recommended she work at a strip club. She has said she became a stripper to escape poverty and domestic violence, having been in an abusive relationship at the time. Cardi B has also said becoming a stripper was positive for her life in many ways: \"It really saved me from a lot of things. When I started stripping I went back to school.\" Cardi B said at the time she was involved in an abusive relationship with whom she lived with in a small Bronx apartment. She says stripping was her only way out, a way to earn enough money to escape her dire situation and get an education. Nonetheless, she ended up dropping out of college.\n\nIn 2013, Cardi B began to gain publicity due to several of her videos going viral on social media, namely Vine and her official Instagram page.\n\nCareer\nMusic\nIn November 2015, Cardi B made her musical debut on Jamaican reggae fusion singer Shaggy's remix to his single \"Boom Boom\", alongside fellow Jamaican dancehall singer Popcaan. She made her music video debut on December 15, 2015, with the song \"Cheap Ass Weave\", her rendition of English rapper Lady Leshurr's \"Queen's Speech 4\". On March 7, 2016, Cardi B released her first full-length project, a mixtape titled Gangsta Bitch Music, Vol. 1. In November 2016, she was featured on the digital cover of Vibe magazine's \"Viva\" issue. On September 12, 2016, KSR Group released the compilation Underestimated: The Album, which is a collaboration between KSR Group artists Cardi B, Hood Celebrityy, SwiftOnDemand, Cashflow Harlem and Josh X. It was previously released only to attendees of their U.S. tour. KSR Group's flagship artist Cardi B said \"I wanted to make a song that would make girls dance, twerk and at the same time encourage them to go get that Shmoney,\" in regards to the compilation's single \"What a Girl Likes.\"\n\nOn January 20, 2017, Cardi B released her second mixtape, which is the second installment to her Gangsta Bitch Music series. In February 2017, Cardi B partnered with MAC Cosmetics and Rio Uribe's Gypsy Sport for an event for New York Fashion Week. In late February, it was reported that Cardi B signed her first major record label recording contract with Atlantic Records. On February 25, 2017, Cardi B was the opening act for East Coast hip hop group The Lox's Filthy America... It's Beautiful Tour, alongside fellow New York City-based rappers Lil' Kim and Remy Ma.

Although she failed to win any awards, losing to Chance the Rapper and Remy Ma, respectively, Cardi B performed at the BET Awards afterparty show. In June 2017, during Hot 97's annual Summer Jam music festival, Remy Ma brought out Cardi B, along with The Lady of Rage, MC Lyte, Young M.A., Monie Love, Lil' Kim and Queen Latifah, to celebrate female rappers and perform Latifah's 1993 hit single \"U.N.I.T.Y.\" about female empowerment.\n\nOn June 16, 2017, Atlantic Records released Cardi B's commercial debut single, titled \"Bodak Yellow\" via digital distribution. In June 2017, it was revealed that Cardi B would be on the cover of The Fader's Summer Music issue for July/August 2017. On July 18, 2017, she performed \"Bodak Yellow\" on The Wendy Williams Show, where she was also interviewed by Williams. When the host asked where her moniker derived from, Cardi B responded with the distilled beverage Bacardi, as people would call her that. Her sister is also nicknamed Hennessy Carolina, referencing the French cognac: \"My sister's name, her name is Hennessy, so everybody used to be like Bacardi to me  then I shortened it to Cardi B, and the 'B' stands for whatever  depending on the day.\"\n\nIn August 2017, \"Bodak Yellow\" entered the top two of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song also reached number one on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. She performed at MoMA PS1 on August 19 to a crowd of 4,000. On the Hot 100 chart dated September 25, 2017, Cardi B claimed the top spot with \"Bodak Yellow\", becoming the first solo female rapper to do so since Lauryn Hill in 1998. \"Bodak Yellow\" was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). With her collaborations \"No Limit\" and \"MotorSport\", she became first female rapper to land her first three entries in the top 10 of the Hot 100, and the first female artist to achieve the same on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\n\nIn October 2017, Cardi B headlined Power 105.1's annual Powerhouse music celebration, alongside The Weeknd, Migos and Lil Uzi Vert, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. In December, she released a collaboration with Puerto Rican singer Ozuna titled \"La Modelo\", and the second single from her debut album, \"Bartier Cardi\".\n\nTelevision\nIn 2015, Cardi B joined the cast of the VH1 reality television series Love & Hip Hop: New York, debuting in season six. She is considered the breakout star of the show's sixth season. The sixth and seventh seasons chronicle her rise to stardom and her turbulent relationship with her incarcerated fiancé.

On April 6, 2016, she was on the twelfth episode of Khloé Kardashian's Kocktails with Khloé: In it, she revealed how she told her mother that she was a stripper. In November, it was announced that she would be joining the cast of the BET series, Being Mary Jane. TVLine describes her character, Mercedes, as a \"round-the-way beauty with a big weave, big boobs and a big booty to match her oversized, ratchet personality.\"\n\nCardi B guest-starred on the celebrity panel show Hip Hop Squares, appearing on the March 13 and April 3, 2017 episodes. On July 18, she appeared on The Wendy Williams Show where she performed \"Bodak Yellow\", as well as answered questions about her name and the status of her love life.\n\nArtistry\nInfluences\nIn Billboard's \"You Should Know\" series, Cardi B said the first albums she ever purchased were by American entertainers Missy Elliott and Tweet, respectively. She also cited American pop singers Madonna and Lady Gaga as two of her favorite artists. She has credited Puerto Rican rapper Ivy Queen and Jamaican dancehall artist Spice as influences as well.\n\nIn an interview with music website Hollywood Unlocked, when asked about the initial direction for her music, Cardi B said, \"When I first started rapping  I liked certain songs from Khia and Trina, and they  fighting songs. I haven't heard fighting songs for a very long time,\" crediting the two female rappers for her aggressive rap style. She continued saying \"a lot of girls they can not afford red bottoms, a lot of girls they can not afford foreign cars  but I know that every girl has beef with a girl  I know that every bitch don't like some bitch, and it's like 'that's what I wanna rap about.'\"\n\nMusical style\nAllMusic editor David Jeffries called Cardi B \"a raw and aggressive rapper in the style of Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown.\" Stereogum called her voice \"a full-bodied New Yawk nasal bleat, the sort of thing that you've heard if someone has ever told you that you stupid for taking too long at swiping your MetroCard.\" They continued to call her voice \"an unabashedly loud and sexual fuck-you New York honk—that translates perfectly to rap.\" In a 2017 Complex article about her, the editor wrote \"unapologetic does not begin to describe the totally unfiltered and sheer Cardi B-ness of Cardi B's personality. She's a hood chick who's not afraid to be hood no matter the setting. Cardi B is Cardi B 24/7, 365, this is why she resonates with people, and that same energy comes out in her music.\"\n\nOther ventures\nFashion\nAs Cardi B rose to prominence she was able to transition from a stripper to modeling for fashion websites In February 2017, she partnered with M.A.C and Rio Uribe's Gypsy Sport for an event for New York Fashion Week. During an April 2017 interview with HotNewHipHop, Cardi B spoke on being rejected by fashion designers. Her April appearance in i-D's \"A-Z of Music\" video was sponsored by designer Marc Jacobs, and she made the cover of The Fader's July/August 2017 Summer Music issue.\n\nIn August 2017, the Style section of the New York Times's Sunday edition did a half-page story on her. The writer reported on her preparations for her first public performance in New York City, at MoMA PS1, describing her appearance as she arrived to the interview in \"leggings, an Atlanta Braves 'Lost Bravos' logo jersey and white Yeezy sneakers\". She also covered Cardi's affinity for Christian Louboutin heels (a running theme in her song \"Bodak Yellow\"), and the custom local designer, LaQuan Smith, whose red dress she wore to perform.\n\nPublic image\nCardi B identifies as a feminist. The New York Times wrote \"on Love & Hip Hop: New York some viewers saw her as a hero of female empowerment, as she made pronouncements like\n\n'Ever since I started using guys, I feel so much better about myself. I feel so damn powerful.'\"\n\nWhen commenting on her rise to stardom The Fader wrote \"one video in particular tipped her popularity over the edge. It was a 13-second clip that doubles as a neat précis of her ethos:\n\n'People be asking me, 'What do you does? Are you a model? Are you, like, a comedian or something?' Nah, I ain't none of that. I'm a hoe. I'm a stripper hoe. I'm about this shmoney.'\"\n\nPersonal life\nReligion\nCardi B is of Christian faith, believing in God and Jesus Christ; she has mentioned her \"strong relationship\" with God in interviews, often saying that she \"talks to Him\": \"If you know me, you know that I have this deep connection to God. Is it crazy for me to say that I used to ask God to please help me? The strip club really helped me. I can say that it saved me…God put that in my way.\"\n\nRelationships\nAs of early 2017, Cardi B began publicly dating fellow American rapper Offset, of the southern hip hop group Migos, and the two quickly became a prevalent couple in the music industry. When speaking on her relationship with Offset, Cardi B told The Fader, \"It’s been a blessing, me meeting him and meeting his friends. I see how hard they work. And that motivated me to work even harder. And I see how good things are going for them and how popping it is to be number one. And I’m like, I want that. A lot of people just see they jewelry and they money, but I don’t think a lot of people see how hard they work for that shit every single day.\" Cardi B and Offset became engaged on October 27, after Offset proposed to Cardi B at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, during the Power 99 Powerhouse concert. According to a report from TMZ, shortly after Offset and Cardi B became engaged, a handful of TV networks, including BET, VH1 and WE tv, began making offers for a nationally televised wedding special.\n\nAwards and nominations\nSee also: List of awards and nominations received by Cardi B\nCardi received her first two nominations at the 2017 BET Awards. In September 2017, the nominees for the annual BET Hip Hop Awards were unveiled, revealing Cardi B to be in the lead, alongside DJ Khaled and Kendrick Lamar, with nine nominations, winning five. She received two nominations at the 60th Grammy Awards: Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song.\n\nIn September 2017, Cardi B's single \"Bodak Yellow\" peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, making Cardi B the first female rapper to top the chart with a solo output since fellow American rapper Lauryn Hill's \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\", debuted atop the chart in 1998. Overall, it made Cardi B the fifth female rapper to ever lead the Hot 100. Cardi B is also noted for being the first person of Dominican Republic descent to reach number one in the history of the Hot 100, since it was launched in 1958. In October, Cardi B broke another Billboard Hot 100 record, when \"Bodak Yellow\" stayed atop the charts for three consecutive weeks, tying with American pop singer Taylor Swift's \"Look What You Made Me Do\" as the longest running female at the number one spot on the charts in 2017.\n\nIn December 2017, Cardi B became the first female rapper to send her first three Billboard Hot 100 entries to the top 10.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Santana is an American Latin rock band formed in San Francisco, California in 1967 by Mexican guitarist Carlos Santana. The band first came to widespread public attention when their performance of \"Soul Sacrifice\" at Woodstock in 1969 provided a contrast to other acts on the bill. This exposure helped propel their first album, also named Santana, into a hit, followed in the next two years by the successful Abraxas and Santana III.\nIn the years that followed lineup changes were common. Carlos Santana's increasing involvement with guru Sri Chinmoy took the band into more esoteric music, though never quite losing its initial Latin influence.\nIn 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Gregg Rolie, Mike Carabello and Michael Shrieve being honored.\nThe band has earned eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards, the latter all in 2000. Carlos also won Grammy Awards as a solo artist in 1989 and 2003. Santana has sold more than 90 million records worldwide, making them one of the world’s best-selling groups of all time. In 2013, Santana announced a reunion of the classic line-up for a new record, predicting a 2014 release. They are tied with having the most won Grammys in one night.",

Further commercial success continued with the albums Mother Nature Calls (1997) and Magic Hour (1999), however the band's fourth album Beetroot (2001) was far less successful which led to the band's split soon after. Cast reunited for a UK tour in November 2010.\n\nNoel Gallagher of Oasis described watching the band live as being like a \"religious experience\" and they were labelled \"The Who of the 90's\".

        "strBiographyEN" : "Chaka Khan (born Yvette Marie Stevens; March 23, 1953), frequently known as the \"Queen of Funk-Soul\", is a 10-time Grammy Award winning American singer-songwriter who gained fame in the 1970s as the frontwoman and focal point of the funk band Rufus.\nWhile still a member of the group in 1978, Khan embarked on a successful solo career. Her signature hits, both with Rufus and as a solo performer, include \"Tell Me Something Good\", \"Sweet Thing\" which she wrote for her then husband Richard Holland, \"Ain't Nobody\", \"I'm Every Woman\", \"I Feel for You\" and \"Through the Fire\". Khan was born Yvette Marie Stevens in Chicago, Illinois. Raised in Chicago's rough South Side housing projects, Khan is the eldest of five children to Charles Stevens and Sandra Coleman. Her sister Yvonne Stevens later became a successful musician in her own right under the name Taka Boom. Her only brother Mark Stevens, who formed the funk group Aurra, also became a successful musician. She has two other sisters, Kathleen Burrell and Tammy McCrary, who is her current manager. Unlike many of her musical contemporaries, Khan was raised as Roman Catholic. Khan attributed her love of music to her grandmother, who introduced her to jazz music as a child. Khan became a fan of R&B music as a preteen and at eleven formed her first all-female singing group the Crystalettes, which also included her sister Taka. In the late 1960s, Khan and her sister formed the vocal group Shades of Black and joined the Black Panther Party after befriending fellow member, activist and Chicago native Fred Hampton in 1967. While a member, she was given a name change to Chaka Adunne Aduffe Hodarhi Karifi by an African shaman. In 1969, she left the Panthers, dropped out of high school, having attended Calumet High School and Kenwood High School (now Kenwood Academy), and began to perform in small groups around the Chicago area, first performing with the group Lyfe, which included her then boyfriend Hassan Khan, whom she'd later marry. Khan was asked to replace the late Baby Huey of Baby Huey & the Babysitters after Huey's untimely death, in 1970. The group disbanded a year later. While performing in local bands in 1972, Khan was spotted by two members of a new group simply called Rufus and soon won her position in the group. The group later signed with ABC Records in 1973. Prior to Khan signing with the label, she married her on-again, off-again boyfriend Hassan Khan, changing her stage name to Chaka Khan.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Changing Faces is an American female R&B duo that was popular from 1993 until 2000. The group consisted of members Cassandra Lucas and Charisse Rose.\n\nLucas and Rose were backing vocalists for Sybil for two years before they formed Changing Faces. The pair returned to New York, where they worked at a dermatologist's office in Manhattan during the day while recording demos at night with producer Dinky Bingham. A local record producer heard the duo singing on the street and signed them to Big Beat Records, a subsidiary of Atlantic.\n\nChanging Faces' first two singles—\"Stroke You Up\" and \"Foolin' Around\"—were written and produced by R. Kelly. The two singles reached the R&B Top Ten in late 1994, with \"Stroke You Up\" peaking at number three on the pop charts. Changing Faces's eponymous debut was released in 1994 and went gold on the strength of the two hits.\n\nChanging Faces returned in 1997 with their second album, All Day, All Night. Kelly produced \"G.H.E.T.T.O.U.T.,\" the first single from the album and their biggest R&B hit to date, reaching number one on the R&B chart, and number eight pop. A track from the album, \"All of My Days\", also appeared on the soundtrack to Space Jam. The group also participates in the soundtrack of the Eddie Murphy movie Dr. Dolittle with the title \"Do Little Things\" feat Ivan Matias in 1998.\n\nTheir third release Visit Me, followed three years later. Visit Me includes the single \"That Other Woman\", which failed to make a major dent on both the pop and R&B charts. However, it did go to number five on the dance club play, becoming their only entry on that chart.\n\nIn August 2009, a new Changing Faces song was leaked online called \"Crazy Luv\". The song is rumored to be on their new album, but has not been confirmed by Lucas or Rose to be their comeback single off their new album, which is rumored to be released sometime in 2012.\n\nOn September 18, 2011, during a special appearance at the RnB Spotlight Concert with Lil Mo' at BB King's Blues Club in NYC, Changing Faces member Lucas announced on Kempire Radio & on YouKnowIGotSoul.com that she and Rose are currently in the recording studio working on a new Changing Faces project that will be released in 2012, with a new single being released soon. She also stated that the group never broke up and is currently working with R. Kelly on new music.\n\nOn April 3, 2013, Changing Faces released a new single \"Hate Love\" via iTunes. And a music video was filmed but was not released. \n\nIn Summer 2013, Lucas left the group, and currently Rose is touring with a new member as Changing Faces.\n\nIn September 2013, it was announced that Cassandra Lucas would be releasing a solo album. Her debut solo single, \"Damn\", was released on September 3, 2013.",

With his older brother Ronnie and younger brother Robert, Wilson often sang in church before their father’s Sunday sermons, accompanied on piano by their mother. He also sang in his junior high school's choir, which was a precursor to his musical career with The Gap Band and later his solo career. \nFrom the start of his career, Charlie and his brothers, Robert and Ronnie, helped define and popularize an upbeat form of funk music that was infectious and lasting with their group The Gap Band. The group's songs such as “Outstanding”, \"Party Train\", \"Yearning for Your Love\", \"Burn Rubber on Me\", “You Dropped a Bomb on Me”, and “Oops Upside Your Head” are among their immense catalog and some of the most sampled songs in music history.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Back in the 60s, rock n roll oddball Rick Nielson began collecting bizarre guitars and studying esoteric British bands like Family and the Move. Tooling around the world, he returned to hometown Rockford, Illinois, and wound up in various outfits with avuncular drummer Bun E. Carlos. With lies of success, Nielson fooled bassist-in-crime Tom Petersson into leaving Europe to join. Soon, young folk singer Robin Zander was on board and Cheap Trick was born.\n\nThe band played anywhere and everywhere, soon opening for the Kinks, Journey and Kiss. Nielson amassed a huge song portfolio before legendary producer Jack (Aerosmith, John Lennon, Zebra) Douglas finally led the quartet into the studio for their self-titled debut in 77. Cheap Trick showcased the Trick throwaway aesthetics of brilliant stupidity (\"Hot Love\"), wily irreverence (\"Daddy Should Have Stayed in High School\") and high-voltage pop genius (\"He’s a Whore,\" \"Oh Candy\"). Chicago murderer Richard Speck was the topic of \"Ballad of TV Violence\" while \"ELO Kiddies\" is the cleverest Japanese toy/nuclear generation/Jeff Lynne song ever. In-house producer Tom Werman cleaned up the follow-up, In Color (77), for the radio and polished their third, Heaven Tonight (78), into a shining AOR gem. Few bands could turn songs about barbiturates (\"Downed\") and suicide (\"Auf Wiedersehen\") into chugging arena anthems, so Cheap Trick prepared for world domination. Merging the lines of metal, punk and Top 40, this golden stage is encapsulated by the brilliant \"Surrender.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the band was already on top in Japan, documented on the stopgap live release At Budokon (79), which pushed the band to platinum status though it was originally intended for Japanese-only release. Thundering versions of \"I Want You to Want Me\" and the oldie \"Ain’t That a Shame\" were actual hits, bolstered by the band’s pioneering visual sense and Live at Leeds propulsion. After the abrupt Budokan, much momentum was lost by the impending release of the studio-intensive Dream Police (79). Though the title track, \"Way of the World,\" and \"I Know What I Want\" were well-crafted singles, the roaring energy circulated by the live platter seemed to evaporate with the heady 70s. Petersson grew disenchanted, pulling a Yoko move with wife Dagmar, and left after the underrated All Shook Up (80), ironically produced by George Martin.\n\nTick lost its commercial footing, unobtrusively releasing over-looked movie songs (two greats on Heavy Metal) for overlooked USA \"Up All Night\" movies and even \"starred\" with Debbie Harry in the animated movie Rock & Rule. Jon Bryant replaced Petersson and Trick dropped three eclectic pop artifacts: the compressed One on One (82) with Queen’s uber-producer Roy Thomas Baker; the quality Next Position Please (83) with kindred spirit Todd Rundgren; and Trick reunited with their first boardman, Jack Douglas, for the guilty pleasure Standing on the Edge (85). But when the clanging and bizarre Doctor (86) also slipped under the pop radar, the ever-encroaching record company took over. Petersson returned for Lap of Luxury (88), a calculated commercial confection with 3D production from Ritchie Zito. Trick scored a number one record with the lighter-ballad \"The Flame.\" And \"Don’t Be Cruel\" was the first Elvis cover to hit the Top Ten since his death. But outside songwriters distanced Trick from their own records, and the vacuous Busted (90) increased the polarity between the power-party stage band and their adult-contemporary schlock tunes. Still playing wicked shows at state fairs and barbecues, Trick seemed to lose heart. \n\nIn 94, a fresh start at Warner Brothers resulted in Woke Up with a Monster which accelerated Trick’s descent into obscurity. But Smashing Pumpkin Billy Corgan, an Illinois native who cut his teeth on vintage Trick, installed a new life force. Trick released another record, reissued their first four classics and began selling out shows again.",

The self-described \"rock and roll band with horns\" began as a politically charged, sometimes experimental, rock band and later moved to a predominantly softer sound, generating several hit ballads. They had a steady stream of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Second only to The Beach Boys in Billboard singles and albums chart success among American bands, Chicago is one of the longest-running and most successful rock groups in history.\n\nAccording to Billboard, Chicago was the leading US singles charting group during the 1970s. They have sold over 38 million units in the US, with 22 gold, 18 platinum, and 8 multi-platinum albums. Over the course of their career they have had five number-one albums and 21 top-ten singles.\nThe original band membership consisted of saxophonist Walter Parazaider, guitarist Terry Kath, drummer Danny Seraphine, trombonist James Pankow, trumpet player Lee Loughnane, and keyboardist/singer Robert Lamm. Parazaider, Kath, Seraphine, Pankow and Loughnane met in 1967 while students at DePaul University. Lamm was recruited from Roosevelt University. The group of six called themselves \"The Big Thing\", and continued playing top 40 hits. Realizing the need for a tenor to complement baritone Lamm and Kath, they added local tenor and bassist Peter Cetera.\n\nJimi Hendrix once told Parazaider, \"Jeez, your horn players are like one set of lungs and your guitar player is better than me.\"\n\nWhile gaining some success as a cover band, the group began working on original songs. In June 1968, they moved to Los Angeles, California under the guidance of their manager James William Guercio, and signed with Columbia Records. After signing with Guercio, The Big Thing changed their name to \"Chicago Transit Authority\".\n\nTheir first record (April 1969), the eponymous Chicago Transit Authority, is a double album, which is rare for a band's first release. It sold over one million copies by 1970, and was awarded a platinum disc. The album included a number of pop-rock songs – \"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\", \"Beginnings\", \"Questions 67 and 68\", and \"I'm a Man\" – which were later released as singles.\n\nWhen the actual Chicago Transit Authority threatened legal action soon after the album's release, the band's name was shortened to Chicago.",

Aguilera signed to RCA Records after recording \"Reflection\", the theme song for the animated film Mulan (1998).\nIn 1999, Aguilera came to prominence following her debut album Christina Aguilera, which was a commercial success spawning three number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100-\"Genie in a Bottle\", \"What a Girl Wants\", and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You).\" Her sophomore and her debut Latin-pop album, Mi Reflejo (2000), a Christmas third studio album, My Kind of Christmas (2000), and several collaborations followed which garnered Aguilera worldwide success, though she was displeased with her lack of input in her music and image. After parting from her management, Aguilera took creative control over her fourth studio album, Stripped (2002). The album's second single, \"Beautiful\", was a commercial success and helped the album's commercial performance amidst controversy over Aguilera's image. Aguilera followed up Stripped with the soul, jazz and blues inspired, Back to Basics (2006), released to positive critical acclaim. The album produced three singles \"Ain't No Other Man\", \"Hurt\" and \"Candyman\".

Aguilera's seventh studio album is set to be released in 2012.\nAside from being known for her vocal ability, music videos and image, musically, she includes themes of dealing with public scrutiny, her childhood, and female empowerment in her music. Apart from her work in music, she has also dedicated much of her time as a philanthropist for charities, human rights and world issues which include her work as a UN ambassador for the World Food Programme. She made her feature film debut in the musical Burlesque (2010), earning Aguilera a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Song.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Charles Edward Anderson \"Chuck\" Berry (born October 18, 1926) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter, and one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as \"Maybellene\" (1955), \"Roll Over Beethoven\" (1956), \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1957) and \"Johnny B. Goode\" (1958), Chuck Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and utilizing guitar solos and showmanship that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music.\nBorn into a middle-class family in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high school student he served a prison sentence for armed robbery between 1944 and 1947. On his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of blues player T-Bone Walker, he was performing in the evenings with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955, and met Muddy Waters, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess of Chess Records. With Chess he recorded \"Maybellene\"-Berry's adaptation of the country song \"Ida Red\"-which sold over a million copies, reaching No. 1 on Billboard's Rhythm and Blues chart. By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star with several hit records and film appearances to his name as well as a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis-based nightclub, called Berry's Club Bandstand. But in January 1962, Berry was sentenced to three years in prison for offenses under the Mann Act-he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines.\nAfter his release in 1963, Berry had several more hits, including \"No Particular Place to Go\", \"You Never Can Tell\", and \"Nadine\", but these did not achieve the same success, or lasting impact, of his 1950s songs, and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgic live performer, playing his past hits with local backup bands of variable quality. His insistence on being paid in cash led to a jail sentence in 1979-four months and community service for tax evasion.\nBerry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in 1986, with the comment that he \"laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance.\" Berry is included in several Rolling Stone \"Greatest of All Time\" lists, including being ranked fifth on their 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll included three of Chuck Berry's songs: \"Johnny B. Goode\", \"Maybellene\", and \"Rock and Roll Music\". Today - at the age of 85 - Berry continues to play live.",

With his backing group The Shadows, Richard, originally positioned as a rebellious rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard and Elvis Presley, dominated the British popular music scene in the pre-Beatles period of the late 1950s and early 1960s. His 1958 hit single \"Move It\" is often described as Britain's first authentic rock and roll song, and John Lennon once claimed that \"before Cliff and the Shadows, there had been nothing worth listening to in British music.\" A conversion to Christianity and subsequent softening of his music later led to a more middle of the road pop image, sometimes venturing into gospel music.\n \nOver a 53-year career, Richard has become a fixture of the British entertainment world, amassing many gold and platinum discs and awards, including three Brit awards and two Ivor Novello awards. He has had more than 130 singles, albums and EPs make the UK Top 20, more than any other artist and holds the record (with Elvis Presley) as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades (1950s-2000s). He has achieved 14 UK No. 1 singles (or 18, depending on the counting methodology) and is the only singer to have had a No. 1 single in the UK in six consecutive decades: the 1950s through to the 2000s (discounting digital downloads and counting only CDs, he had a UK No. 1 single in the 2000s). Richard is the third biggest selling singles artist of all time in the UK, with total sales of over 21 million, and has reportedly sold an estimated 250 million records worldwide.\n \nRichard has never achieved the same impact in the United States despite eight US Top 40 singles, including the million-selling \"Devil Woman\" and \"We Don't Talk Anymore\", the latter becoming the first to reach the Hot 100's top 40 in the 1980s by a singer who had been in the top 40 in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. In Canada, Richard achieved moderate success in the 1980s with several albums reaching platinum status.

The band's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), was released to critical acclaim and won multiple awards, including NME's Album of the Year, and has been widely considered the best of the Nelson-produced Coldplay albums. Their next release, X&Y, the best-selling album worldwide in 2005, was met with mostly positive reviews upon its release, though some critics felt that it was inferior to its predecessor. The band's fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), was produced by Brian Eno and released again to largely favourable reviews, earning several Grammy nominations and wins at the 51st Grammy Awards. On 24 October 2011, they released their fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto, which was met with mixed to positive reviews, and was the UK's best-selling rock album of 2011.\n\nThe band has won a number of music awards throughout their career, including seven Brit Awards winning Best British Group three times, four MTV Video Music Awards, and seven Grammy Awards from twenty nominations. As one of the world's best-selling music artists, Coldplay have sold over 55 million records worldwide. In December 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the fourth best artist of the 2000s.\n\nColdplay have been an active supporter of various social and political causes, such as Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign and Amnesty International. The group have also performed at various charity projects such as Band Aid 20, Live 8, Sound Relief, Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief, The Secret Policeman's Ball, and the Teenage Cancer Trust.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "William \"Count\" Basie (August 21, 1904 – April 26, 1984) was an American jazz pianist, organist, bandleader, and composer. His mother first taught him piano and he started performing in his teens. Dropping out of school, he learned to operate lights for vaudeville and to improvise accompaniment for silent films at a local movie theater in his town of Red Bank, New Jersey. By 16, he increasingly played jazz piano at parties, resorts and other venues. In 1924, he went to Harlem, where his performing career expanded; he toured with groups to the major jazz cities of Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City. In 1929 he joined Bennie Moten's band in Kansas City, and played with them until Moten's death in 1935.\n\nThat year Basie formed his own jazz orchestra, and in 1936 took them to Chicago for a long engagement and their first recording. He led the group for almost 50 years, creating innovations like the use of two \"split\" tenor saxophones, emphasizing the rhythm section, riffing with a big band, using arrangers to broaden their sound, and others. Many notable musicians came to prominence under his direction, including the tenor saxophonists Lester Young and Herschel Evans, the guitarist Freddie Green, trumpeters Buck Clayton and Harry \"Sweets\" Edison and singers Jimmy Rushing and Joe Williams. Basie's theme songs were \"One O'Clock Jump,\" developed in 1935 in the early days of his band, and \"April In Paris\".\n",

        "strBiographyEN" : "In the eyes of their audience, the three musicians in Cream represented the best players of their respective instruments - the \"cream\" of British rock musicianship, as it were. The blues-rock trio came together in 1966. Already, Clapton had attained recognition as Britain’s preeminent guitarist as a result of his tenure with the Yardbirds and John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers. Bassist Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger Baker boasted an impressive pedigree as well, having been the rhythm section for the Graham Bond Organization, a blues-jazz band fronted by organist-singer Bond.\n\nDriven by thoughts of moving from straight blues into a new kind of pop music - one that took note of directions emerging from London’s underground scene - Baker approached Clapton about forming a band. Clapton’s sole proviso was that Jack Bruce must be the bassist. As rock’s first \"supergroup\" Cream aimed to break new ground, according to Clapton in an interview from that time, \"What we want to do is anything that people haven’t done before\" he said. In actuality, the group remained grounded in the blues while expanding the vocabulary of rock with extended improvisations during their live shows and forays into psychedelia on record.\n\nCream's debut album, Fresh Cream, mixed blues standards (\"I’m So Glad\", \"Spoonful\") with original compositions (\"I Feel Free\", \"N.S.U.\"). On Disraeli Gears, the band's second album, the group dove headlong into a fanciful world of psychedelic sounds and textures while retaining a blues-rock underpinning. Cream ranks among the vanguard musicians of that genre with such mind-bending numbers as \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" and \"Sunshine of Your Love.\" Wheels of Fire, a double album from 1968, displayed the group’s split personality. One disc was given over to song-oriented studio recordings (e.g. \"White Room\"), while the other consisted of live tracks (including their definitive rock version of Robert Johnson’s \"Crossroads\") recorded at the Fillmore in San Francisco.\n\nIn July 1968, Cream announced they were disbanding at the end of the year. They played their farewell show on November 26, 1968, at London’s Albert Hall, and released the album Goodbye two months later. During Cream's brief two-year history, the group of singularly gifted musicians made groundbreaking music and epitomized the questing spirit of their art. \"Eric, Ginger and I wanted to turn each other on\", Jack Bruce said later. \"The only good music is when good musicians play for each other. I believe that’s what made Cream so different from the other rock groups.\"",

Born to a large family from Charlemagne, Quebec, Dion emerged as a teen star in the French-speaking world after her manager and future husband René Angélil mortgaged his home to finance her first record. In 1990, she released the English-language album Unison, establishing herself as a viable pop artist in North America and other English-speaking areas of the world.\n\nDion had first gained international recognition in the 1980s by winning both the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival and the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest. Following a series of French albums in the early 1980s, she signed on to CBS Records Canada in 1986. During the 1990s, with the help of Angélil, she achieved worldwide fame after signing with Epic Records and releasing several English albums along with additional French albums, becoming one of the most successful artists in pop music history. However, in 1999 at the height of her success, Dion announced a hiatus from entertainment in order to start a family and spend time with her husband, who had been diagnosed with cancer. She returned to the top of pop music in 2002 and signed a three-year (later extended to almost five years) contract to perform nightly in a five-star theatrical show at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Paradise, Nevada.\n\nDion's music has been influenced by genres ranging from rock and R&B to gospel and classical. While her releases have often received mixed critical reception, she is renowned for her technically skilled and powerful vocals. Dion is the best-selling Canadian artist of all time, is the second best-selling female artist in the US during the Nielsen SoundScan era, and is the only female artist to have two singles sell more than a million copies in the UK. In addition, her 1995 album D'eux, is the best-selling French-language album of all time. In 2004, after surpassing 175 million in album sales worldwide, she was presented with the Chopard Diamond Award at the World Music Awards for becoming the best-selling female artist of all time. According to Sony Music Entertainment, Dion has sold over 200 million albums worldwide.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Daft Punk are an electronic music duo consisting of French musicians Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. The duo achieved significant popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement and were met with continued success in the years following, combining elements of house music with funk, techno, disco, rock, and synthpop. The are also known for their visual stylization and disguises associated with their music; specifically, the duo have worn ornate helmets and gloves to assume robot personas in most of their public appearances since 2001. They rarely grant interviews or appear on television.\nBangalter and de Homem-Christo were originally in a rock band called Darlin' together, which disbanded after a short period of time, leaving the two to experiment musically with drum machines and synthesizers. The duo became Daft Punk, releasing their debut album Homework on Virgin Records in 1997 to highly-positive reviews. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records. The 2001 release of Discovery was even more successful, driven by the club singles \"One More Time\", \"Digital Love\", and \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\". In March 2005, the duo released the album Human After All to mixed reviews. However, the singles \"Robot Rock\" and \"Technologic\" achieved success in the United Kingdom.\nDaft Punk toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album Alive 2007, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album. The duo composed the score of the film Tron: Legacy in 2010 and released its soundtrack album. In January 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin Records for Sony Music Entertainment's subsidiary label Columbia, and released Random Access Memories in 2013 to worldwide critical acclaim. The album's lead single \"Get Lucky\" became an international success, peaking in the top 10 in 32 countries. Random Access Memories led to five Grammy wins in 2014, including Album of the Year as well as Record of the Year for \"Get Lucky\".",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Damon Albarn (/ˈdeɪmən ˈælbɑrn/; born 23 March 1968 in Whitechapel, London) is an English musician, singer-songwriter and record producer. He is best known for being the frontman of the alternative rock band Blur as well as the vocalist and principal songwriter of virtual band Gorillaz.\nRaised in Leytonstone, London and around Colchester, Essex, Albarn attended Stanway Comprehensive School where he met Graham Coxon and eventually formed Blur whose debut album, Leisure, was released in 1990 to mixed reviews. After spending long periods of time touring the United States, Albarn's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s. The result of these influences came in the form of Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). All three albums received widespread critical acclaim while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK, aided by a rivalry shared with Oasis. Subsequent albums contained influences from lo-fi, electronic and hip hop music.\nIn 1998, Albarn along with Tank Girl creator Jamie Hewlett, formed the \"virtual band\" Gorillaz. Drawing influences from hip hop, electronica, dub and alternative rock, the band released their self-titled debut album in 2001 which was hugely successful worldwide. Although Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor, the albums feature many collaborations from a wide range of artists. Gorillaz are cited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the \"Most Successful Virtual Band\".\nOther projects include working with African musicians in aid of the charity Oxfam, writing and performing lead vocals on The Good, the Bad and the Queen as part of an unnamed supergroup featuring Tony Allen, Paul Simonon and Simon Tong and composing film soundtracks. He has also ventured into the world of opera with Doctor Dee and Monkey: Journey to the West.\nAlbarn was voted the fourth-greatest frontman of all time in a 2010 UK Poll for Q Music magazine.",

Lyrical themes focus on topics ranging from love, sex, the enjoyment and appreciation of life, to ending racism, and political and anti-war statements. The founding members were singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Matthews, bassist Stefan Lessard, drummer/backing vocalist Carter Beauford and saxophonist LeRoi Moore. Boyd Tinsley was added to the band as a violinist soon after the band was formed. Moore died suddenly in August 2008 due to complications from an ATV accident. Grammy Award-winner Jeff Coffin, of Béla Fleck and the Flecktones, has since filled Moore's spot as the band's saxophonist. Rashawn Ross and Tim Reynolds have also become full-time touring members of the band. As of 2010, Dave Matthews Band has approximate sales between 30 and 40 million copies worldwide.\nThe band is known for their annual summer-long tours of the US and Europe, featuring lengthy improvisational renditions of their songs, accompanied by an elaborate video and lighting show. This portion of the tour has become a stamp of DMB and has grown with the band since Fenton Williams began in the early 1990s. After twenty consecutive years of touring the band announced that it is going to take the summer of 2011 off. The band's most recent album, Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King (the first since Moore's death) debuted at number one on Billboard 200, giving the band their fifth consecutive number one debut, making them the second band behind Metallica to do so.\nThe band has won one Grammy Award, and was awarded the NAACP Chairman's Award. According to Julian Bond, \"they sell out the largest arenas on Earth, but frequently give their music away.\"",

        "strBiographyEN" : "David Robert Jones (8 January 1947, Brixton, London, England – 10 January 2016, New York, USA), better known by his stage name David Bowie (/ˈboʊi/), was an English singer, songwriter and actor. He was a figure in popular music for over five decades, regarded by critics and musicians as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, his music and stagecraft significantly influencing popular music. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at 140 million worldwide, made him one of the world's best-selling music artists. In the UK, he was awarded nine platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, releasing eleven number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and seven gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\nBorn and raised in south London, Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"Space Oddity\" became his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single \"Starman\" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as \"plastic soul\", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the album Young Americans. In 1976, Bowie began a sporadic acting career, starring in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth. The following year, he further confounded musical expectations with the electronic-inflected album Low (1977), the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that would come to be known as the \"Berlin Trilogy\". \"Heroes\" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He then reached his commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance, with its title track topping both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. Bowie also continued acting; his roles included Major Celliers in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), the Goblin King Jareth in Labyrinth (1986), Pontius Pilate in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped concert touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with the release of The Next Day and remained musically active until he died of liver cancer two days after the release of his final album, Blackstar (2016).",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Dean Martin (born Dino Paul Crocetti; June 7, 1917 – December 25, 1995) was an American singer, film actor, television star and comedian.\nOne of the most popular and enduring American entertainers of the mid-20th Century, Martin was nicknamed the \"King of Cool\" due to his seemingly effortless charisma and self-assuredness. A member of the \"Rat Pack,\" Martin was a major star in four areas of show business: concert stage/night clubs, recordings, motion pictures, and television. He was the host of the successful television variety program The Dean Martin Show (1965-1974), and subsequently The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts (1974-1985)\nMartin's relaxed, warbling crooning voice earned him dozens of hit singles including his signature songs \"Memories Are Made of This\", \"That's Amore\", \"Everybody Loves Somebody\", \"You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You\", \"Sway\", \"Volare\" and \"Ain't That a Kick in the Head?\".\nMartin was born in Steubenville, Ohio, to an Italian father, Gaetana and an Italian-American mother, Angela Crocetti (née Barra). His father was from Montesilvano, Pescara, Abruzzo, Italy, and his mother was of Neapolitan and Sicilian ancestry. Martin had an older brother named Bill. Martin spoke only Italian until he started school. He attended Grant Elementary School in Steubenville, and took up the drums as a hobby as a teenager. He was the target of much ridicule for his broken English and ultimately dropped out of Steubenville High School in the 10th grade because he thought that he was smarter than his teachers. He delivered bootleg liquor, served as a speakeasy croupier, was a blackjack dealer, worked in a steel mill and boxed as a welterweight. He grew up a neighbor to Jimmy the Greek.\nAt the age of 15, he was a boxer who billed himself as \"Kid Crochet\". His prizefighting years earned him a broken nose (later straightened), a scarred lip, and many sets of broken knuckles, bruised body (a result of not being able to afford the tape used to wrap boxers' hands). Of his twelve bouts, he would later say \"I won all but eleven.\" For a time, he roomed with Sonny King, who, like Martin, was just starting in show business and had little money. It is said that Martin and King held bare-knuckle matches in their apartment, fighting until one of them was knocked out; people paid to watch. Martin knocked out King in the first round of an amateur boxing match.\nEventually, Martin gave up boxing. He worked as a roulette stickman and croupier in an illegal casino behind a tobacco shop where he had started as a stock boy. At the same time, he sang with local bands, calling himself \"Dino Martini\" (after the famous Metropolitan Opera tenor, Nino Martini). He got his first break working for the Ernie McKay Orchestra. He sang in a crooning style influenced by Harry Mills (of the Mills Brothers), among others. In the early 1940s, he started singing for bandleader Sammy Watkins, who suggested that he change his name to Dean Martin.\nIn October 1941, Martin married Elizabeth Anne McDonald. During their marriage (ended by divorce in 1949), they had four children. Martin worked for various bands throughout the early 1940s, mostly on looks and personality until he developed his own singing style. Martin famously flopped at the Riobamba, a high class nightclub in New York, when he followed Frank Sinatra in 1943, but it was the setting for their meeting.\nMartin was drafted into the United States Army in 1944 during World War II, serving a year stationed in Akron, Ohio. He was then reclassified as 4-F and was discharged (possibly because of a double hernia; Jerry Lewis referred to the surgery that Martin needed for this in his autobiography).\nBy 1946, Martin was doing relatively well, but was still little more than an East Coast nightclub singer with a common style, similar to that of Bing Crosby. He drew audiences to the clubs where he played, but he inspired none of the fanatical popularity enjoyed by Sinatra.",

They released several demos as Mantas before changing their name in 1984.\n\nDeath is widely considered one of the most influential bands in the genre. The band’s debut, “Scream Bloody Gore”, has been described as “death metal’s first archetypal document,” and Schuldiner himself as the “father of death metal”. However, Schuldiner dismissed such attributions in an interview with Metal-Rules.com, stating, “I don’t think I should take the credit for this death metal stuff. I’m just a guy from a band, and I think Death is a metal band.”\n\nAs of 2008, Death has sold over 1.5 million albums worldwide, with 368,184 albums having been sold in the US alone (not counting sales prior to the Soundscan era), making them one of the top-selling death metal bands of all time. After the album “Spiritual Healing”, Death began moving away from their early death metal sound and adopting more of a progressive metal style, with jazz-influenced bass playing and more complex time signatures. Their best-selling album, “Human”, was released in 1991 and is considered by many to be the band in top-form. Their last album, “The Sound of Perseverance”, was released in 1998.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "A garage rock and protopunk demo band formed in Detroit, Michigan, in 1971 by brothers Bobby Hackney(bass, vocals) / David Hackney (guitar) / Dannis Hackney (drums).\nIn 1964, the three young Hackney brothers were sat down by their father to witness The Beatles’ first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. The following day, David found a discarded guitar in an alley and set about learning to play. Brothers Bobby and Dannis soon followed suit and they began playing music together.\nThe brothers practiced and recorded early demos in a room in the family home and performed their earliest gigs from their garage. Originally calling themselves RockFire Funk Express, guitarist David convinced his brothers to change the name of the band to Death. “His concept was spinning death from the negative to the positive. It was a hard sell,” Bobby Hackney recalled in 2010.\nIn 1974 at Detroit’s United Sound Studios with engineer Jim Vitti, they recorded seven songs written by David and Bobby. According to the Hackney family, Columbia Records president Clive Davis funded the recording sessions, but implored the band to change its name to something more commercially palatable than Death. When the Hackneys refused, Davis ceased his support. The band only recorded seven songs instead of the planned dozen. The following year they self-released (on their label Tryangle Records) a single taken from the sessions: “Politicians in My Eyes / Keep On Knocking” in a run of just 500 copies.\nThe Hackney brothers ended the band in 1977. The brothers then moved to Burlington, Vermont and released two albums of gospel rock as The 4th Movement in the early 1980s. David moved back to Detroit in 1982, and died of lung cancer in 2000. Bobby and Dannis still reside in Vermont and lead the reggae band Lambsbread.\nIn 2008 the sons of Bobby Hackney Sr (Julian, Urian, and Bobby Hackney Jr) started a band called Rough Francis covering the songs of Death after discovering the old recordings in their parents attic.\nIn 2009, Drag City Records released all seven Death songs from their 1975 United Sound sessions on CD and LP under the title …For the Whole World To See. In September 2009, a reformed Death played three shows with original members Bobby and Dannis Hackney, with Lambsbread guitarist Bobbie Duncan taking the place of the late David Hackney.\nDuring a 2010 performance at the Boomslang Festival in Lexington, Kentucky the band announced that Drag City would release a new album with demos and rough cuts that predate the 1974 sessions. The album Spiritual Mental Physical was released in January 2011.\nAn independent documentary film titled A Band Called Death, directed by Jeff Howlett and Mark Covino, was released in 2012.\nIn 2013 the EP Relief/Story of the World was released.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Death Cab for Cutie is an American alternative rock band formed in Bellingham, Washington in 1997. The band consists of Ben Gibbard (vocals, guitar, piano), Chris Walla (guitar, production, keyboards), Nick Harmer (bass) and Jason McGerr (drums). Death Cab for Cutie's music has been labeled as indie rock, indie pop, emo, and alternative rock, and is noted for its use of unconventional instruments as well as Gibbard's unique lyrical style. The band has released seven studio albums, five EPs, and one demo to date. The group takes its name from a song featured in The Beatles' 1967 film, Magical Mystery Tour.\nGibbard's first album, You Can Play These Songs with Chords, was released as a demo, leading to a record deal with Barsuk Records. It was at this time that Gibbard decided to expand the project into a complete band, and recruited band members to join. In 1998, the band released its debut album, Something About Airplanes, followed by We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes in 2000; both records were positively received in the indie community. Lineup changes ensued both before and after the release of the The Photo Album (2001), and the group's album Transatlanticism (2003) gained the band commercial success. After signing with Atlantic Records, Death Cab For Cutie released Plans in 2005, which contained the singles \"Soul Meets Body\" and \"Crooked Teeth\". The 2007 record Narrow Stairs served as a stylistic departure for the group. The band released their seventh album, Codes and Keys, on May 31, 2011.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Deborah Ann \"Debbie\" Harry is an American singer-songwriter actress and former Playboy Bunny best known for being the lead singer of the punk rock and new wave band Blondie. She has also had success as a solo artist, and in the mid-1990s she recorded and performed with The Jazz Passengers. Her acting career spans over 30 film roles and numerous television appearances.\nHarry was born in Miami, Florida, and adopted by Catherine Harry and Richard Smith, gift shop proprietors in Hawthorne, New Jersey. She attended Hawthorne High School, where she graduated in 1963. She graduated from Centenary College in Hackettstown, New Jersey, with an Associate of Arts degree in 1965. Before starting her singing career she moved to New York City in the late 1960s and worked as a secretary at BBC Radio's office there for one year. Later, she was a waitress at Max's Kansas City, a go-go dancer in Union City, New Jersey, discothèque, and a Playboy Bunny. \nIn the late 1960s, Deborah Harry began her musical career as a backing singer for the folk rock group, The Wind in the Willows, which released one self-titled album in 1968 on Capitol Records. The group also recorded a second album which was never released and the studio tapes remain lost to this day.\nIn 1974, Harry then joined The Stilettos with Elda Gentile and Amanda Jones. The Stilettos included her eventual boyfriend and Blondie guitarist, Chris Stein. \nAfter leaving The Stilettos, Harry and Stein formed Angel and the Snake with Tish and Snooky Bellomo. Shortly thereafter, Harry and Stein formed Blondie, naming it after the term of address men often called her when she bleached her hair blonde. Blondie quickly became regulars at Max's Kansas City and CBGB in New York City. After a debut album in 1976, commercial success followed in the late 1970s to the early 1980s, first in Australia and Europe, then in the United States.\nIn 1989 and 2010 interviews, Harry claimed that she had been lured into a car driven by serial killer, Ted Bundy, while in New York during the early 1970s but said that she luckily escaped. While Harry has claimed to identify the driver as Bundy from TV news reports, the fact-checking website snopes.com says the driver was probably not Bundy because there is no known record that Bundy was in New York at that time. Snopes noted that Ann Rule, an author of a book on Bundy, says false claims of Bundy abductions are not uncommon.\nWhile leading Blondie, Harry and Stein became life as well as musical partners, though they never married. Harry has no children. In the mid-1980s, she took a few years off to care for Stein while he suffered with pemphigus, a rare autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. Stein and Harry broke up in the 1980s, but continued to work together. In 1999, Harry was deemed the 12th greatest woman of rock and roll by VH1's 100 Greatest Women of Rock & Roll and in 2002, she was called the 18th sexiest artist of all time by VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists.\nWith her two-tone bleached-blonde hair, Harry quickly became a punk icon. Her look was further popularized by the band's early presence in the music video revolution of the era. She was a regular at Studio 54. In June 1979, Blondie was featured on the cover of Rolling Stone. Harry's persona, combining cool sexuality with streetwise style, became so closely associated with the group's name that many came to believe \"Blondie\" was the singer's name. The difference between the individual Harry and the band Blondie was famously highlighted with a \"Blondie is a group\" button campaign by the band in 1979. In 1981, Harry issued a press release to clarify that her name was not \"Debbie Blondie\" or \"Debbie Harry\", but Deborah Harry, though Harry later described her character in the band as being named \"Blondie\", as in this quote from the No Exit tour book:“\tHi, it's Deb. You know, when I woke up this morning I had a realization about myself. I was always Blondie. People always called me Blondie, ever since I was a little kid. What I realized is that at some point I became Dirty Harry. I couldn't be Blondie anymore, so I became Dirty Harry.\nIn 1976 and 1977, Blondie released their first two albums. The second experienced some marginal success outside the United States. However, 1978's Parallel Lines (UK No.1, US No.6) shot the group to international success and included the global smash hit single \"Heart of Glass.\" Riding the crest of disco's domination, the infectious track hit No.1 in the US and sold nearly two million copies. The follow-up single \"One Way Or Another\" reached No.24 on Billboard's Hot 100. The album was the band's biggest success. Although it has sold over 4 million copies in the United States alone, it has never been certified above the Platinum level. It was also the biggest selling album of 1979 in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe release of the platinum-selling Eat to the Beat album (UK No.1, US No.17) in 1979 and Autoamerican (UK No.3, US No.7) in 1980 continued the band's run of hits, including \"Dreaming\", \"Atomic\" and three more US No.1 singles: \"The Tide Is High\", \"Rapture\" and \"Call Me\" from the soundtrack to the film American Gigolo, which became Billboard's No.1 song of 1980.\n \n Promotional photo from 1982.\n\nAfter a year-long hiatus in 1981, during which Harry released her first solo album (see below), Blondie regrouped and released their sixth studio album The Hunter (UK No.9, US No.33). The album met with a disastrous reception, peaking at No.33 in the US and falling rapidly off the charts. The single \"Island of Lost Souls\" briefly cracked the US Top 40 though narrowly missed the top ten in the UK, where the album had been a top ten entry but sold far less than their previous albums. Blondie launched a worldwide tour to support the release, but it was cut short due to slow ticket sales. Stein also fell seriously ill with the rare autoimmune disease, pemphigus. Coupled with declining record sales and internal struggles, the band split up.\nLater in the 1980s, the remix album Once More Into The Bleach was released, featuring remixes of tracks by Blondie and from Harry's solo career. The mid-1990s saw the release of further Blondie remix albums Beautiful in Europe and Remixed Remade Remodeled in the US. New mixes of \"Heart of Glass\", \"Atomic\" and \"Union City Blue\" were released as singles and all made the UK Top 40, while remixes of \"Atomic\", \"Rapture\" and \"Heart of Glass\" had major success on the US dance charts.\nIn 1997, Blondie began working together again for the first time in 15 years. Two tracks were recorded with TV Mania, the production trio of two Duran Duran members, Nick Rhodes and Warren Cuccurullo, and producer Anthony J. Resta. \"Studio 54\" and \"Pop Trash Movie\" were scheduled for release on a Blondie compilation, entitled This Is Blondie. However, the project and the tracks were shelved as the four original members (Harry, Stein, Clem Burke and Jimmy Destri) embarked on sessions for what would become Blondie's seventh studio album. During this period, they released a cover of Iggy Pop's \"Ordinary Bummer\" on the tribute album We Will Fall (1997).\n\nAfter a final tour of Europe with The Jazz Passengers in the summer of 1998, Deborah Harry resumed duties as lead vocalist of Blondie. Prior to the release of No Exit, the band completed a sold out tour of Europe. Dates at London's Lyceum Theatre were recorded by the BBC and aired on national BBC Radio 1. A week before the release of No Exit, the lead single \"Maria\" debuted at No.1 in the UK, giving Blondie their sixth UK No.1 hit. \"Maria\" also reached No.1 in 14 different countries, the top 10 on the US Dance Charts and Top 15 on the US Adult Top 40 Charts. No Exit debuted at No.3 in the UK and No.17 in the US, and Blondie announced dates for a major arena tour that summer, during which they played the Glastonbury Festival and Party in the Park in London. \"Nothing Is Real but the Girl\" was another UK Top-30 hit, while the title track was released as a limited-edition single to coincide with further arena dates in November of that year.\n\nTracks culled from dates throughout the 1999 world tour were released as a live album, titled Live in the US and Livid in the UK and were released in late 1999 and early 2000, respectively. A Blondie Live companion DVD was also released, recorded at a show in New York City's The Town Hall.\nAlthough Blondie commenced recording tracks for the follow-up to No Exit in 2001, the sessions were dogged with problems including the loss of master tapes after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In the winter of 2002, Blondie returned with a full-scale UK tour. This preceded the release of a new single in 2003 entitled \"Good Boys\" (a hit across the UK and Europe that autumn, and top 10 on the US Dance Charts the following spring) and the release of Blondie's eighth studio album, The Curse of Blondie. The band toured throughout 2003 and 2004, completing two further full-scale tours of the UK.\nA second live album, entitled Live By Request, was released in 2005, along with a companion DVD set. In that year, the band also released the mash-up \"Rapture Riders,\" which combined their 1981 hit \"Rapture\" with The Doors' \"Riders on the Storm\". This track was taken from a greatest hits compilation entitled Sound and Vision (first issued in the UK as Sight + Sound), released with a companion DVD and new mixes of \"In the Flesh\" and \"Good Boys\".\nIn the winter of 2005, Blondie toured the UK for the fourth time in as many years. In 2006, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Around this time, Blondie released a new studio track, a cover of Roxy Music's 1982 hit \"More Than This\". This was to promote their \"Road Rage\" tour and the single was made available for free download.\nAt the end of 2006, a new mix of \"Heart of Glass\" became a club hit in Europe, while Harry released the single \"New York New York\", a collaboration with Moby. The song debuted on YouTube, some four weeks before its official release.\nIn the summer of 2007, Blondie toured in the UK once again. Around this time, Harry delineated the different personae (Blondie the band, her role in the band, and Deborah Harry the singer) to an interviewer who asked why she played only solo music on the 2007 True Colors Tour: \"I've put together a new trio with no Blondie members in it — I really want to make a clear definition between Debbie's solo projects and Blondie — and I hope that the audience can appreciate that and also appreciate this other material.\"  \nOn July 3, 2008, Blondie commenced a world tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Parallel Lines with a sell-out concert at the amphitheatre in Ra'anana, Israel. During the tour, drummer Clem Burke stated that the tour had inspired the band to make another record, Panic of Girls, their first new album since the release of The Curse of Blondie in 2003.\n\nAlso in 2008, Blondie's music was featured in the young adult novel, \"Debbie Harry Sings in French,\" by Meagan Brothers, which received awards from the American Library Association and the New York Public Library.\n\nIn 2009, Blondie joined Pat Benatar for the Call Me Invincible tour. The majority of the shows were opened by The Donnas. In December 2009, Blondie recorded their version of the traditional song \"We Three Kings\" to coincide with the band's new album.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Blondie began a UK and Ireland tour, including venues in Newcastle, Manchester, Sheffield and Dublin. They also played festivals including the Isle of Wight and Rockness Festival in Inverness, Scotland. Tracks from their forthcoming album Panic of Girls were performed during their tour of the UK, notably 'D-Day' and 'What I Heard'.\n\nThe album was released first in July 2011 in the United Kingdom, with Germany, USA and Japan following. As a marketing innovation, the band made a lot of special editions with different bonus tracks and added content, such as extra CDs and magazines. It received good reviews from the press and spotted No.1 in Amazon. \"Mother\" was the first single, accompanied by a video, and \"What I Heard\" was the second. Blondie's tenth album, Ghosts of Download, is set for release in Autumn 2013.\nHarry has released five solo albums. She began her solo career in 1981 with KooKoo. Produced by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of Chic, the album peaked at No. 28 in the US and No. 6 in the UK; it was later certified gold in the US and Silver in the UK. \"Backfired\", the first single from the album, had a video directed by H. R. Giger (who also created the album's front cover featuring Harry's face with metal skewers through it). The single reached No. 43 on the Billboard Hot 100, No. 29 on the Hot Dance Club Songs and No. 32 on the UK Singles Chart. \"The Jam Was Moving\" was lifted as the second single and peaked at No. 82 in the US. After Blondie split up in 1982, Harry's solo output slowed down as she cared for ailing partner Chris Stein. She released the single \"Rush Rush\" in 1983 (produced by Giorgio Moroder and taken from the film Scarface), but this was unsuccessful. A new single, \"Feel The Spin\" (taken from the film Krush Groove) was released as a limited 12\" single in 1985, but again was unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1986, Harry released her second solo album called Rockbird, which peaked at No. 97 in the US and No. 31 in the UK (where it has been certified Gold for 100,000 sales by the BPI). The single \"French Kissin' in the USA\" gave Harry her only UK solo top 10 hit (No. 8) and became a moderate US hit (No. 57). Other singles released from the album were \"Free to Fall\" and \"In Love with Love\", which hit No. 1 on the US Dance Charts and was released with several remixes.\n\nHer next solo venture was the album Def, Dumb and Blonde in 1989. At this point Harry reverted from \"Debbie\" to \"Deborah\" as her professional name. The first single \"I Want That Man\" was a hit in Europe, Australia, and on the US Modern Rock Charts. The success of the single propelled the album to No. 12 on the UK chart where it earned a Silver disc. However, with little promotion from her record company in the US, it peaked at No. 123. She followed this up with the ballad \"Brite Side\" and the club hit \"Sweet and Low\". \"Maybe for Sure\", a track originally recorded by Blondie for the Rock and Rule animated film, was the fourth single released from the album in June 1990 to coincide with a UK tour (her second in six months). \"Kiss It Better\" was also a Top 15 Modern Rock single in the US.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1991, Harry toured extensively across the world with former Blondie guitarist Chris Stein, Underworld's Karl Hyde, and future Blondie bassist Leigh Foxx. In July 1991, she played Wembley Stadium supporting INXS. In 1991, Chrysalis released a new \"best of\" compilation in Europe entitled The Complete Picture: The Very Best of Deborah Harry and Blondie, containing hits with Blondie as well as solo hits. The collection reached No. 3 in the UK album chart and earned a Gold disc. The album also included her duet with Iggy Pop on the Cole Porter song \"Well, Did You Evah!\" from the Red Hot + Blue AIDS charity album produced by the Red Hot Organization and released at the end of 1990.\n\nHarry's fourth solo album, Debravation, appeared in July 1993. The album's first single was \"I Can See Clearly\", which peaked at No. 23 in the UK and No. 2 on the US dance charts. This was followed by \"Strike Me Pink\" in September. Controversy surrounded the latter track's promotional video, which featured a man drowning in a water tank, resulting in it being banned. US editions of the album feature two additional tracks recorded with pre-recorded music by R.E.M.: \"Tear Drops\" and \"My Last Date (With You),\" a remake of a 1961 Skeeter Davis hit.\n\nIn November 1993, Harry toured the UK with Stein, Peter Min, Greta Brinkman and James Murphy. The set list of the Debravation Tour featured an offbeat selection of Harry material including the previously unreleased track \"Close Your Eyes\" (from 1989) and \"Ordinary Bummer\" (from the Stein-produced Iggy Pop album Zombie Birdhouse; a track that, under the moniker \"Adolph's Dog,\" Blondie covered in 1997). Tentative plans to record these shows and release them as a double live CD never came to fruition. However, a cover of The Rolling Stones' \"Wild Horses\" is available as a bootleg. At the end of 1993, Chrysalis released the Blondie rarities collection Blonde and Beyond, which featured the previously unreleased tracks \"Scenery\" and \"Underground Girl\". In early 1994, Harry took the Debravation tour to the US. In the UK, Harry's long tenure with Chrysalis Records also came to an end after lacklustre sales of Debravation, but the label released all of Blondie's albums and Harry's KooKoo album (for the first time on CD) as remastered editions with bonus tracks.\n\nAs Blondie had reconvened in the late 1990s, it was several years before Harry resumed her solo career. In 2006, Harry started work in New York City on tracks for her fifth solo album Necessary Evil (2007). Working with production duo Super Buddha (who produced the remix of Blondie's \"In the Flesh\" for the 2005 Sound and Vision compilation), the first music to surface in was a hip hop track entitled \"Dirty and Deep\" in which she spoke out against rapper Lil' Kim's incarceration.\n\nThroughout 2006, a number of new tracks surfaced on Harry's MySpace page, including \"Charm Alarm\", \"Deep End\", \"Love With A Vengeance\", \"School for Scandal\" and \"Necessary Evil\", as well as duets she recorded with Miss Guy (of Toilet Böys fame). These were \"God Save New York\" and \"New York Groove\". A streaming version of the lead single, \"Two Times Blue\", was added to Harry's MySpace page in May 2007. On 6 June 2007, an iTunes downloadable version was released via her official website.\nHarry joined Cyndi Lauper's True Colors Tour for the Human Rights Campaign. She is a strong advocate for gay rights and same-sex marriage. Though she has stated that she identifies as mostly heterosexual, Harry has said she has had intimate relationships with both men and women. \n\nHarry's fifth solo album, Necessary Evil, was released in 2007 on Eleven Seven Music after Harry completed both a solo tour of the US in June 2007 and a European tour with Blondie in July 2007. The first single, \"Two Times Blue\", peaked at No. 5 on the US Dance Club Play chart. The album peaked at No. 86 in the UK and No. 37 in the US Billboard Top Independent Albums chart.\n\nTo promote the album, Harry appeared on various talk shows to perform \"Two Times Blue\". She also started a 22-date US tour on November 8, lasting until December 9, playing small venues and clubs across the country. On January 18, 2008, an official music video for \"If I Had You\" was released. \nWhile recording her fourth album in 1992, Harry collaborated with German heavy metal band Die Haut on the track \"Don't Cross My Mind\", and released the song \"Prelude to a Kiss\" on the soundtrack to the film of the same name. She also released a cover of \"Summertime Blues\" from the soundtrack to the film That Night in Australia.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Harry teamed up with New York avant-garde jazz ensemble The Jazz Passengers. Between 1994 and 1998 she was a permanent member of the troupe, touring North America and Europe. She was a featured vocalist on their 1994 album In Love singing the track \"Dog In Sand\". The follow-up album, 1997's Individually Twisted, is credited as \"The Jazz Passengers featuring Deborah Harry\" and Harry sings vocals throughout, teaming up with guest Elvis Costello for a cover of \"Doncha Go Way Mad\". The album also features a re-recorded version of the song \"The Tide Is High\". A live album entitled Live In Spain, again featuring Harry on vocals, was released in 1998.\n\nHarry collaborated on a number of other projects with other artists. She featured as vocalist on Talking Heads side project The Heads' 1996 release No Talking, Just Head (performing the title track and \"Punk Lolita\"). She also sings on a cover of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and on the song \"Estrella de Mar\" by Argentine band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. In 1997 she collaborated with Jazz Passenger Bill Ware in his side project Groove Thing, singing lead vocals on the club hit \"Command and Obey\". Another JP collaboration appeared on the Edgar Allan Poe tribute album Closed on Account of Rabies (1997). Harry also reunited with Blondie keyboardist Jimmy Destri for a cover of Otis Blackwell's \"Don't Be Cruel\" for the 1995 tribute album Brace Yourself. During this period, she also recorded a duet with Robert Jacks entitled \"Der Einzige Weg (The Only Way) - Theme from Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\" which was recorded in German and in English, although these did not surface until 1999.\n\nHarry appears on the 2001 Bill Ware album Vibes 4 singing the track \"Me and You\" as well as on ex-Police guitarist Andy Summers's album Peggy's Blue Skylight on the track \"Weird Nightmare\". A techno cover of Stan Jones' \"Ghost Riders in the Sky\" was featured on the soundtrack to the film, Three Business Men, and was available on her website to download. Harry sings on two tracks on Andrea Griminelli's Cinema Italiano project: \"You'll Come To Me\" (inspired by Amarcord's main theme) and \"When Love Comes By\" (from Il Postino), as well as on a tribute album reinterpreting the music of Harold Arlen, on which she sings the title track \"Stormy Weather\". In May 2002, she accompanied The Jazz Passengers and the BBC Concert Orchestra in a performance of her jazz material at the Barbican Centre in London.

        "strBiographyEN" : "It all started in 1968 when Chris Curtis, an ex-Searcher, formed a group withDave Curtiss (no relation, note different spelling) on bass, Bobby Woodman-Clarke on drums and brought in ex-Artwoods organist Jon Lord (born 9 June 1941, Leicester, England) and ex-Johnny Kidd andThe Pirates bassist, Nick Simper (born 3 November 1946, Southall, Middlesex).Nick had survived the car crash that had killed Johnny Kidd in 1966. GuitaristRitchie Blackmore (born 14 April 1945, Weston-super-Mare, England) joined inrehearsals for this new act initially dubbed Roundabout. Curtis dropped outwithin days, and when Dave and Bobby also proved incompatible, two members ofMaze, Rod Evans (born 19 January 1945, Edinburgh, Scotland; vocals) and IanPaice (born 29 June 1948, Nottinghamshire; drums), replaced them.\n\nHaving adopted the Deep Purple name (apparently inspired by Ritchie'sgrandmother's favorite song) following a brief Scandinavian tour in April 1968(where they played as Roundabout, \"in case they flopped\"), the quintetbegan recording their debut album, which they patterned on USA group VanillaFudge. \"Shades of Deep Purple\" thus included dramatic rearrangementsof well-known songs, including a faithful cover of Hendrix's version of\"Hey Joe\" and the Joe South-penned, Billy Joe Royal hit\"Hush\", the latter hitting US #4 in 1968 but not troubling the UKchart-compilers one bit.\n\nLengthy tours ensued as the group, all but ignored at home, steadfastly courtedthe burgeoning American concert circuit. \"The Book Of Taliesyn\" and\"Deep Purple\" albums also featured several excellent reworkings,notably \"Kentucky Woman\" (Neil Diamond) and \"River Deep MountainHigh\" (Ike And Tina Turner). The lengthy intro section to \"RiverDeep\" was a dramatic work-out of the theme from the then recently releasedStanley Kubrick sci-fi classic film \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". Thispiece was based on Richard Strauss' \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\" and JonLord's classical leanings would soon culminate in a self-composed full-lengthwork performed at the  Royal Albert Hall in September 1969.\n\nThe band also drew acclaim for their original material and the dramaticinterplay between Lord and Blackmore. In concert these guitar/organ duels couldgo on for over 20 minutes!\n\nIn July 1969 both Evans and Simper were axed from the line-up, which was thenbuoyed by the arrival of Ian Gillan (born 19 August 1945, Hounslow, Middlesex,England; vocals) and Roger Glover (born 30 November 1945, Brecon, Wales; bass)from the pop group Episode Six. Acknowledged by aficionados as the\"classic\" Deep Purple line-up (forever onwards known as Mark II), thereshaped quintet made its album debut on the grandiose \"Concerto For GroupAnd Orchestra\", scored by Lord and recorded with the Royal PhilharmonicOrchestra conducted by Malcolm Arnold (later sir Malcolm).\n\nIts hard rock successor, \"In Rock\", established the group as aleading heavy metal attraction and introduced such enduring favorites as\"Speed King\" and \"Child In Time.\" Gillan's powerfulsilver-throated vocals brought a third dimension to their sound and thisnew-found popularity in the UK was enhanced when the single, \"BlackNight\" reached number 2. \"Strange Kind Of Woman\" followed itinto the Top 10 (reaching #8 in Feb 1971), while \"Fireball\" and \"Machine Head\" both toppedthe album charts. The latter included the riff-laden \"Smoke On TheWater\", based on a real incident involving Frank Zappa and The Mothersand  an infamous Montreaux concert.\n\nAlthough the platinum-selling \"Made In Japan\" captured their liveprowess in full flight, relations within the band grew increasingly strained,and \"Who Do We Think We Are!\" would be the end of this highlysuccessful line-up.  The departures of Gillan and Glover robbed DeepPurple of an expressive frontman and imaginative arranger, although DavidCoverdale (born 22 September 1949, Saltburn-by-the-Sea, Lancashire, England;vocals) and Glenn Hughes (born 21 August 1952, Penkridge, Staffordshire;ex-Trapeze, bass & vocals) brought a new impetus to the act.\"Burn\" and \"Stormbringer\" both reached the Top 10, butBlackmore grew increasingly dissatisfied with the group's direction and in May1975 left to form Rainbow. US guitarist Tommy Bolin (born 18 April 1951, SiouxCity, Idaho), formerly of the James Gang and who had impressed Coverdale withhis playing on Billy Cobham's \"Spectrum\", joined Deep Purple for\"Come Taste The Band\", but his jazz/soul style was incompatible withthe group's heavy metal sound, and a now-tiring act folded in 1976 following afarewell UK tour.\n\nBolin died of a heroin overdose within months of Purple's demise. Judiciousarchives and 'best of' releases kept the group in the public eye, as did thehigh profile enjoyed by its several ex-members. Successful off-shoot bandsinclude Whitesnake, Rainbow and Gillan. Pressure for a reunion bore fruit in1984 when Gillan, Lord, Blackmore, Glover and Paice (the original Mark II)completed \"Perfect Strangers\". A whole new generation of fansdiscovered Deep Purple through this  release and subsequent US, Japaneseand European tour. A second album, \"The House Of Blue Light\",followed, but recurring animosity between Gillan and Blackmore resulted in thesinger's departure following the disappointing live album \"Nobody'sPerfect\" which included a 1988 rehearsal re-working of their first hit\"Hush\".\n\nJoe Lynn Turner, one of Blackmore's many Rainbow vocalists, joined and gave theband more of an AOR (Adult-Orientated Rock) direction. After a disappointingSlaves & Masters album released in 1990 (though Fire In The Basement isclassic 70s Purple), better sense prevailed. Gillan was re-admitted for histhird stint, uncomfortably sharing stage and studio with Blackmore. The line-upremained stable while the band recorded \"The Battle Rages On\" albumreleased in 1993, but Blackmore jumped ship once more during the tour thatfollowed. The tour was completed courtesy of US guitar whizzkid Joe Satriani.Contractual obligations however, meant his tenure could only be short-term andPurple hurriedly enlisted Steve Morse (ex-Kansas, Dixie Dregs, The Steve MorseBand, et al) (born 28 July 1954, Hamilton, Ohio) as his replacement to recordPurpendicular released early in 1996.\n\nSetting off on tour again, they took a fresh look at their 70s repertoire; tourhighlights were captured on the \"Live at the Olympia\" CD (1997) with forgottenfavorites jostling for position against new material from the \"Purpendicular\"set. Suddenly they felt they could have fun again, and the concerts wereenlivened by dropping old faves like \"Lazy\" and \"SpaceTruckin'\" in favour of new material and songs from the back catalogue thathad seldom if ever been played (such as \"Bloodsucker\", \"No OneCame\" and \"Rat Bat Blue\").\n\n1998's \"Abandon\" album had all the classic rock attitude, nasty guitars, poundingdrums and driving bass to scratch that R.O.C.K. itch. The album included abrilliant reworking of \"In Rock\"'s \"Bloodsucker\" (retitled\"Bludsucker\") and the Floydish-style \"Watching The Sky\"amongst other driving rock tracks.\n\nIn 1999 Deep Purple had a very successful tour of Australia and Europe. \n\nJon Lord retired in 2002 and was replaced by journeyman keyboardist Don Airey. This new line-up, which left Ian Paice as the only original member, released the stunning \"Bananas\" album in August 2003. Both a return-to-form and a look to the future, the \"Bananas\" album was well-accepted by the rock community at large.\n\nIn 2012 Deep Purple will record and release a new album.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Def Leppard are an English rock band formed in 1977 in Sheffield as part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. Since 1992, the band has consisted of Rick Savage (bass, backing vocals), Joe Elliott (lead vocals), Rick Allen (drums, backing vocals), Phil Collen (guitar, backing vocals), and Vivian Campbell (guitar, backing vocals). Therefore, this is the band's longest-standing lineup.\n\nThe band's strongest commercial success came between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Their 1981 album High 'n' Dry was produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, who helped them begin to define their style, and the album's stand out track \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\" became one of the first metal videos played on MTV in 1982. The band's next studio album Pyromania in 1983, with the lead single \"Photograph\", turned Def Leppard into a household name. In 2004, the album ranked number 384 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nDef Leppard's fourth album Hysteria, released in 1987, topped the U.S and UK album charts. As of 2009 it has 12x platinum sales in the United States, and has gone on to sell over 20 million copies worldwide. The album spawned six hit singles, including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one \"Love Bites\", alongside \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\", \"Hysteria\", \"Armageddon It\", \"Animal\" and \"Rocket\".\n\nTheir next studio album Adrenalize (the first following the death of guitarist Steve Clark) reached number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and UK Album Chart in 1992, and contained several hits including, \"Let's Get Rocked\" and \"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\". Their 1993 album Retro Active contained the acoustic hit song \"Two Steps Behind\", while their greatest hits album Vault released in 1995 featured the new track \"When Love & Hate Collide\".\n\nAs one of the world's best-selling music artists, Def Leppard have sold more than 100 million albums worldwide, and have two albums with RIAA diamond certification, Pyromania and Hysteria. They are one of only five rock bands with two original studio albums selling over 10 million copies in the U.S. The band were ranked No. 31 in VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" and ranked No. 70 in \"100 Greatest Artists Of All Time\". Def Leppard are currently touring in support of their recently released live album, Mirrorball.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Depeche Mode are an English electronic music band formed in 1980 in Basildon, Essex. The group's original line-up consisted of Dave Gahan (lead vocals, occasional songwriter since 2005), Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981), Andy Fletcher (keyboards) and Vince Clarke (keyboards, chief songwriter 1980-81). Vince Clarke left the band after the release of their 1981 debut album, Speak & Spell, and was replaced by Alan Wilder (keyboards, drums, occasional songwriter) with Gore taking over songwriting. Wilder left the band in 1995; Gahan, Gore, and Fletcher have since continued as a trio.\nDepeche Mode's origins date back to 1977, when schoolmates Vince Clarke and Andy Fletcher formed a The Cure-influenced band called No Romance in China, with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass. Fletcher would later recall, \"Why am I in the band? It was accidental right from the beginning. I was actually forced to be in the band. I played the guitar and I had a bass; it was a question of them roping me in.\" In 1979, Clarke played guitar in an \"Ultravox rip-off band\", The Plan, with friends Robert Marlow and Paul Langwith. In 1978–79, Martin Gore played guitar in an acoustic duo, Norman and The Worms, with school friend Phil Burdett on vocals. In 1979, Marlow, Gore, and friend Paul Redmond formed a band called The French Look, with Marlow on vocals/keyboards, Gore on guitar and Redmond on keyboards. In March 1980, Clarke, Gore and Fletcher formed a band called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar, Gore on keyboards and Fletcher on bass.\nSoon after the formation of Composition of Sound, Clarke and Fletcher switched to synthesisers, working odd jobs in order to buy or borrow the instruments from friends. Dave Gahan joined the band in 1980 after Clarke heard him perform at a local scout hut jam session, singing to a rendition of David Bowie's \"Heroes\", and Depeche Mode were born. When explaining the choice for the new name taken from a French fashion magazine, Dépêche mode (from French dépêche that means here \"dispatch\" - from Old French despesche/despeche - or \"news report\" and mode that means \"fashion\"), Martin Gore said, \"It means hurried fashion or fashion dispatch. I like the sound of that.\" Gore recollects that the first time the band played as Depeche Mode was a school gig in May 1980. The band made their recording debut in 1980 on the Some Bizzare Album with the song \"Photographic\", which was later re-recorded for their debut album Speak & Spell.\nThe band made a demo tape but, instead of mailing the tape to record companies, they would go in and personally deliver it. They would demand the companies play it; according to Dave Gahan, \"most of them would tell us to **** off. They'd say 'leave the tape with us' and we'd say 'it's our only one'. Then we'd say goodbye and go somewhere else.\"\nAccording to Gahan, prior to securing their record contract, they were receiving offers from all the major labels. Phonogram offered them \"money you could never have imagined and all sorts of crazy things like clothes allowances\".\nWhile playing a live gig at the Bridge House in Canning Town, the band were approached by Daniel Miller, an electronic musician and founder of Mute Records, who was interested in their recording a single for his burgeoning label. The result of this verbal contract was their first single, \"Dreaming of Me\", recorded in December 1980 and released in February 1981. It reached number 57 in the UK charts. Encouraged by this, the band recorded their second single, \"New Life\", which climbed to number 11 in the UK charts. The next single was \"Just Can't Get Enough\". This relentlessly upbeat piece of synthpop became the band's first UK top ten hit and it remains one of their best known songs. It was also the first Depeche Mode song to get a music video and is the only one of the band's videos to feature Vince Clarke. Depeche Mode's debut album, Speak & Spell, was released in November 1981 and peaked at number ten on the UK album charts. Critical reviews were mixed – Melody Maker described it as a \"great album... one they had to make to conquer fresh audiences and please the fans who just can’t get enough\", while Rolling Stone was more critical, calling the album \"PG-rated fluff\".",

The song was featured on the soundtrack of the film Bad Boys.  In 1997, her album Think Like a Girl entered Billboard's Top Reggae Albums chart at No.1. She also reached's Hot 100's top 40 with her cover version of the song \"I Say a Little Prayer\", which was featured in the soundtrack to the film My Best Friend's Wedding. She was also featured on the 1997 soundtrack to the documentary When We Were Kings, where she performed a duet of the same title with Brian McKnight. In 1998 she joined Celine Dion and Brownstone on stage to perform their hit \"Treat Her Like A Lady\" at the Essence Awards, in which they received a standing ovation. That year she also appeared on Soul Train, The RuPaul Show, and VIBE to promote Think Like a Girl.  By the new millennium, King was in negotiations with Madonna's Maverick label. In 2002 King released her third album Respect, it became a hit overseas, but was never released in the US, despite its first single \"Summer Breezin'\" receiving BET and VH1 video and radio airplay.  In 2007, she co-wrote and recorded the song \"The Light Within\" with the German reggae artist Gentleman, for his album Another Intensity. She also had the girl duo Brick & Lace join her on one of her concerts as backup singers. Later that year, she formed her own record label, ThinkLikeAgirl. She also tours Asia annually.  In 2010, King's record label ThinkLikeAgirL Music Inc. went through a licensing deal with Warner Music Japan with the release of her fourth album, Warrior Gurl. This was released in Japan on 22 September 2010.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Dire Straits were a British rock band, formed in 1977 by former journalist and teacher Mark Knopfler, initially composed of Knopfler (lead vocals and lead guitar), his younger brother David Knopfler (rhythm guitar and backing vocals), John Illsley (bass guitar and backing vocals), and Pick Withers (drums and percussion).\n Dire Straits' sound drew from a variety of musical influences, including jazz, folk, blues, and came closest to beat music within the context of rock and roll. Despite the prominence of punk rock during the band's early years, the band's stripped-down sound contrasted with punk, demonstrating a more \"rootsy\" influence that emerged out of pub rock. Many of Dire Straits' compositions were melancholic.\n Dire Straits' biggest selling album, Brothers in Arms, has sold over 30 million copies. They also became one of the world's most commercially successful bands, with worldwide album sales of over 120 million. Dire Straits won numerous music awards during their career, including four Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards-winning Best British Group twice, and two MTV Video Music Awards. The band' most popular songs include \"Sultans of Swing\", \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Tunnel of Love\", \"Private Investigations\", \"Money for Nothing\", \"Walk of Life\", \"So Far Away\", \"Your Latest Trick\" and \"Brothers in Arms\".\n Dire Straits' career spanned 18 years. There were several changes in personnel over that period, leaving Mark Knopfler and John Illsley as the only two original bandmates who had remained throughout the band's career. Dire Straits disbanded in 1995 when Mark Knopfler launched his career full time as a solo artist.",

A five-time Grammy Award winner, Summer was the first artist to have three consecutive double albums reach number one on the United States Billboard chart and charted four number-one singles in the United States within a 13-month period.\n\nBorn into a devoutly Christian middle class African American family in Boston, Massachusetts, Summer first became involved with singing through church choir groups before joining a number of bands influenced by the Motown Sound. Influenced by the counterculture of the 1960s, she became the front singer of a psychedelic rock band named Crow and moved to New York City. Joining a touring version of the musical Hair, she spent several years living in West Germany, where she married Helmut Sommer, whose surname she adopted as her stage name.\n\nReturning to the United States, Summer co-wrote the song \"Love to Love You Baby\" with Pete Bellotte; music producer Giorgio Moroder convinced her to sing it herself and it was released in 1975 to mass commercial success, particularly on the disco scene. Over the following years, Summer followed this success with a string of other disco hits, such as \"I Feel Love\", \"MacArthur Park\", \"Hot Stuff\", \"Bad Girls\" and \"No More Tears (Enough is Enough)\". Becoming known as the \"Queen of Disco\", she regularly appeared at the Studio 54 club in New York City while her music gained a particularly large following within the gay community. Struggling with depression, she subsequently became a born-again Christian in 1980.\n\nDiagnosed with lung cancer, Summer died on May 17, 2012, at her home in Naples, Florida. She was posthumously described as the \"undisputed queen of the Seventies disco boom\" who reached the status of \"one of the world's leading female singers.\" Moroder described Summer's work with him on the song \"I Feel Love\" as \"really the start of electronic dance\" music.\n\nIn December 2012, it was announced that Summer would be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.",

He has produced albums for and overseen the careers of many rappers, including The D.O.C., Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Xzibit, Knoc-turn'al, 50 Cent, The Game and Kendrick Lamar. He is credited as a key figure in the popularization of West Coast G-funk, a style of rap music characterized as synthesizer-based with slow, heavy beats.

His 1992 solo debut The Chronic, released under Death Row Records, led him to become one of the best-selling American performing artists of 1993 and to win a Grammy Award for the single \"Let Me Ride\". That same year he produced Death Row labelmate Snoop Dogg's quadruple platinum debut Doggystyle, and even molded artists into top-notch producers such as his step-brother Warren G, which led to his multi-platinum debut Regulate...G Funk Era in 1994, and Snoop Dogg's cousin Daz Dillinger which led to the double platinum debut album Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound in 1995.\nIn 1996, he left Death Row Records to establish his own label, Aftermath Entertainment. He produced a compilation album titled Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath in 1996, and released a solo album titled 2001 in 1999. During the 2000s, he focused on production for other artists, while occasionally contributing vocals to songs. Dr. Dre signed Eminem in 1998 and 50 Cent in 2002 to his record label respectively, while contributing production on their albums. He has won six Grammy Awards, including Producer of the Year.

The album was released on June 15, 2010, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The album has since gone platinum. He released his second studio album on November 15, 2011 titled Take Care. Drake was set to release an R&B mixtape sometime in the future along with a collaboration album with Lil Wayne, however, both have been postponed for various reasons.\n\nDrake has worked with several other hip-hop artists such as Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, Kanye West, Eminem, Jay-Z, and Nicki Minaj.

Drake attended high school at Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he began acting, but did not graduate. He spent most summers with his father in Memphis. Drake stated that his parents' divorce greatly affected him as a person, saying, â€œI had to become a man very quickly and be the backbone for a woman who I love with all my heart, my mother.\"",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Dream Theater is an American progressive metal band formed in 1985 under the name Majesty by John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy while they attended Berklee College of Music in Massachusetts. They subsequently dropped out of their studies to further concentrate on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010 when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for Portnoy's replacement drummer. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011.\n\nThe band is well known for the technical proficiency of its instrumentalists, who have won many awards from music instruction magazines. Guitarist John Petrucci has been named as the third player on the G3 tour six times, more than any invited players. In 2009 he was named the No. 2 best metal guitarist by Joel McIver in his book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists. He was also named as one of the \"Top 10 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time\" by GuitarOne magazine. Former drummer Mike Portnoy has won 23 awards from Modern Drummer magazine and is also the second youngest person (at the age of 37) to be inducted into the Rock Drummer Hall of Fame. His replacement Mike Mangini has also previously set 5 WFD records. John Myung was voted the greatest bassist of all time in a poll conducted by MusicRadar in August through September 2010. The band was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nThe band's highest-selling album is the gold-selling Images and Words (1992), which reached #61 on the Billboard 200 chart. Both the 1994 release Awake and their 2002 release Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also entered the charts at #32 and #46 respectively and received mostly positive reviews. Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory was ranked number 95 on the October 2006 issue of Guitar World magazine's list of The greatest 100 guitar albums of all time. It is ranked as the 15th Greatest Concept Album (as of March, 2003) by Classic Rock Magazine. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also led to Dream Theater becoming the initial band reviewed in the music section of Entertainment Weekly during its opening week of release, despite the magazine generally preferring more mainstream music. In 2007, Systematic Chaos entered U.S. Billboard 200 at #19. By 2008, Dream Theater had sold over 2.1 million albums in the U.S. and by 2011, over 12 million records worldwide.\n\nThe band's eleventh studio album, A Dramatic Turn of Events, was released on September 13, 2011. It entered the U.S. Billboard 200 at #8, two positions lower than their previous release Black Clouds & Silver Linings which entered the Billboard 200 chart at #6. The album is the band's first with Mike Mangini, since Mike Portnoy's departure. On November 30, 2011 it was announced that On the Backs of Angels was nominated for a Grammy Award in the \"Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance\" category, marking the band's first ever Grammy nomination.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Dru Hill is an American singing group, most popular during the late 1990s, whose repertoire included R&B, soul, and gospel music. Founded in Baltimore, Maryland, and active since 1992, Dru Hill recorded seven Top 40 hits, and is best known for the R&B #1 hits \"In My Bed\", \"Never Make a Promise\", and \"How Deep Is Your Love\". Tamir \"Nokio\" Ruffin was the group's founder; his bandmates included lead singer Mark \"Sisqó\" Andrews, Larry \"Jazz\" Anthony, and James \"Woody Rock\" Green. Signing to Island Records through Haqq Islam's University Records imprint, the group released two successful albums, Dru Hill and Enter the Dru, before separating for a period from late 1999 to 2002, during which time Sisqó and Woody released solo albums. While Woody's Soul Music LP was a moderate success in the gospel music industry, Sisqó's debut album, Unleash the Dragon, and its hit single, \"Thong Song\", were major pop successes, and established Sisqó as a household name outside of Dru Hill. His second album, Return of Dragon, wasn't much of a success. He is currently working on his third album, Last Dragon. In 2002, by then part of the Def Soul record label, the group reunited and added fifth member Rufus \"Scola\" Waller to the lineup for their third album, Dru World Order. The album was a huge disappointment which forced the group to be released from Def Jam and go on a second hiatus. In 2010, the group signed to Kedar Entertainment Group and released their fourth album, InDRUpendence Day, with new member Tao, after Woody left for the second time.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Synonymous with Bay Area rap, E-40 garnered a regional following, and eventually a national one, with his flamboyant raps, while his entrepreneurial spirit, embodied by his homegrown record label, Sick Wid' It Records, did much to cultivate a flourishing rap scene to the east of San Francisco Bay, in communities such as Oakland and his native Vallejo. Along with Too Short, Spice 1, and Ant Banks, E-40 was among the first Bay Area rappers to sign to a major label, penning a deal with Jive Records in 1994. They'd spent years releasing music independently, going back as far as 1990 when Sick wid' It released Let's Side, a four-track EP by the Click, a group comprised of E-40, his cousin B-Legit, his brother D-Shot, and his sister Suga T. Throughout the '90s and into the early 2000s, E-40 and his Sick wid' It associates released a series of albums on Jive, and though they weren't big sellers nationally, they were well received regionally and proved highly influential, not only on the West Coast but also in the South, thanks in part to Master P, who began his No Limit Records empire in the Bay Area (i.e., Richmond) in the early to mid-'90s before relocating to New Orleans. E-40's ties to the South became more direct in the mid-2000s, when, upon the expiration of his deal with Jive, he partnered with Atlanta rapper/producer Lil Jon and his BME Recordings label, in association with Warner Bros. The first album to be released as part of this partnership, My Ghetto Report Card (2006), was E-40's most successful in years. Concurrently, the Bay Area rap scene, with its so-called hyphy style, was growing in popularity nationally, and there was no bigger champion of the Bay and its style than E-40, whose innumerable guest features helped foster the scene and whose son, producer Droop-E, had grown to become one of hyphy's foremost practitioners.\n\nBorn Earl Stevens on November 15, 1967, in Vallejo, California, E-40 made his rap debut in 1990 on Let's Side, the aforementioned four-track EP by the Click. The EP was co-produced by Mike Mosley and Al Eaton. In 1993 E-40 made his solo album debut, Federal, a nine-track LP/14-track CD produced by Studio Ton and released by Sick Wid' It in association with SMG (Solar Music Group), a regional distributor. Then in 1994, on the strength of the regionally popular independently released single \"Captain Save a Hoe\" (aka \"Captain Save 'Em Thoe\") from the six-track Mail Man EP, E-40 signed a recording contract with Jive Records, the home of Bay Area pioneer Too Short since 1987. Jive re-released \"Captain Save a Hoe\" on 12\" and also re-released the Mail Man EP, adding two bonus tracks; all the songs on the EP, including \"Captain Save a Hoe,\" were produced by Studio Ton, except one of the bonus tracks, \"Ballin' Out of Control,\" which was produced by Mike Mosley and Sam Bostic. In 1995 Jive released four E-40 albums: a re-release of Down and Dirty, a 1994 album by the Click; Game Related, a newly recorded album by the Click; a reconfigured version of Federal, his 1993 solo debut; and In a Major Way, a newly recorded album produced by Studio Ton, Mike Mosley/Sam Bostic, and Funk Daddy. Of these numerous releases, In a Major Way proved E-40's breakthrough; featuring a collaboration with fellow Bay Area hardcore rappers 2Pac, Mac Mall, and Spice 1, \"Dusted 'n' Disgusted,\" in addition to several songs that would also become fan favorites (\"Da Bumble,\" \"Sideways,\" \"Sprinkle Me,\" \"1-Luv\"), the album was very well received regionally and took the rapper's career to a new level of respectability.\n\nBeginning with Tha Hall of Game (1996), E-40 released six additional solo albums on Jive -- The Element of Surprise (1998), Charlie Hustle: The Blueprint of a Self-Made Millionaire (1999), Loyalty and Betrayal (2000), Grit & Grind (2002), Breakin News (2003) -- plus one further album by the Click, Money & Muscle (2001). Over the course of these albums, E-40 maintained his regional following and picked up additional fans nationally, yet he never did break into the mainstream. Besides \"Captain Save a Hoe,\" only two of his Jive singles ever charted on the Billboard Hot 100 (\"1-Luv,\" 1995; \"Things'll Never Change,\" 1996), and following his initial burst of popularity from 1994 to 1996, his sales generally declined from one album to the next. E-40's career isn't well measured by chart hits and album sales, though, for he more or less remained an underground rapper, albeit one with a major-label contract, working almost exclusively with an inner circle of Bay Area rappers and producers. His long list of guest features is representative of his popularity (not to mention his generosity), as practically every regional act sought his presence. A guest feature by E-40 gave an unknown West Coast rapper instant credibility, even if it didn't amount to a national hit. During the late '90s, E-40 also began being featured as a guest on Southern rap albums (for example, appearing on 8ball's Lost, Master P's MP Da Last Don, and Scarface's My Homies in 1998 alone).\n\nE-40's ties to the South became most clear in 2006, after the expiration of his contract with Jive, when he partnered with Lil Jon and his BME Recordings label for My Ghetto Report Card, released in association with Warner Bros. The album -- featuring production from Lil Jon as well as Bay Area beatmakers Droop-E, Rick Rock, Studio Ton, and Bosko -- was E-40's most successful in years, arguably since Tha Hall of Game (1996) or even In a Major Way (1995), and it marked his return to the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time in a decade, with a pair of impressively charting singles: \"Tell Me When to Go,\" featuring Keak da Sneak (number 35), and \"U and Dat,\" featuring T-Pain (number 13). His 2008 effort The Ball Street Journal featured the Lil Jon production “Break Ya Ankles\" as its lead single, followed by the Akon feature “Wake It Up.” Two years later he returned with the ambitious Revenue Retrievin' project, a double album split into two separate releases. The Day Shift version featured the more street-oriented cuts while the Night Shift version was filled with club tracks. The project turned into a quadrilogy in 2011 with the simultaneous release of his 13th (the varied Revenue Retrievin': Overtime Shift) and 14th (the very dark Revenue Retrievin': Graveyard Shift) albums. A year later he would return with another batch of releases, this time divided in three single discs titled The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil, Pt. 1, 2, and 3.",

At the end of the 20th century, two of their albums, Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975) and Hotel California, were ranked among the 20 best-selling albums in the United States according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Hotel California is ranked 37th in Rolling Stone's list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" and the band was ranked number 75 on the magazine's 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\nThe Eagles are one of the world's best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 150 million records—100 million in the U.S. alone—including 42 million copies of Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975) and 32 million copies of Hotel California. \"Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)\" was the best selling album of the 20th century in the U.S. They are the fifth-highest-selling music act and the highest-selling American band in U.S. history.\nThe Eagles released their self-titled debut album in 1972, which spawned three top 40 singles: \"Take It Easy\", \"Witchy Woman\", and \"Peaceful Easy Feeling\". Their next album, Desperado (1973), was less successful than the first, only reaching number 41 on the charts; neither of its singles reached the top 40. However, the album contained two of the band's most popular tracks: \"Desperado\" and \"Tequila Sunrise\". They released On the Border in 1974, adding guitarist Don Felder as its fifth member midway through the recording of the album. The album generated two top 40 singles: \"Already Gone\" and their first number one, \"Best of My Love\".\nTheir 1975 album One of These Nights included three top 10 singles: \"One of These Nights\", \"Lyin' Eyes\", and \"Take It to the Limit\", the first hitting the top of the charts. The Eagles continued that success and hit their commercial peak in late 1976 with the release of Hotel California, which would go on to sell more than 16 million copies in the U.S. alone and more than 32 million copies worldwide. The album yielded two number-one singles, \"New Kid in Town\" and \"Hotel California\". They released their last studio album for nearly 28 years in 1979 with The Long Run, which spawned three top 10 singles: \"Heartache Tonight\", \"The Long Run\", and \"I Can't Tell You Why\", the lead single being another chart-topping hit.\nThe Eagles disbanded in July 1980 but reunited in 1994 for the album Hell Freezes Over, a mix of live and new studio tracks. They have toured consistently since then and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2007, the Eagles released Long Road Out of Eden, their first full studio album in 28 years and their sixth number one album. The next year they launched the Long Road Out of Eden Tour in support of the album. In 2013, they began the extended History of the Eagles Tour in conjunction with the band's documentary release, History of the Eagles.",

Wright was born to Richard and Kathie Wright in Compton, California. His uncle is the singer and band member Charles Wright, who formed the Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band. After dropping out of high school in the tenth grade, he supported himself primarily by selling drugs before investing in Ruthless Records and becoming a rapper. When Ruthless artists Dr. Dre and Ice Cube wrote \"Boyz-n-the-Hood\", Dre, Cube, and Eazy formed N.W.A. After DJ Yella, MC Ren, and Arabian Prince joined the group, N.W.A released N.W.A. and the Posse. In 1988, they released their most controversial album, Straight Outta Compton. The group released two more albums and then disbanded after Eazy released Dr. Dre from his contract.\n\nEazy's main influences included 1970s funk groups, contemporary rappers, and comedians. When reviewing Eazy's albums, many critics noted his unique overall style, with Steve Huey of the All Music Guide summing up: \"While his technical skills as a rapper were never the greatest, his distinctive delivery (invariably described as a high-pitched whine), over-the-top lyrics, and undeniable charisma made him a star.\" On February 24, 1995, Eazy was admitted into Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles with what he believed to be asthma, but was instead diagnosed with AIDS. On March 16 he acknowledged his condition publicly, and died due to complications ten days later.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Echo & the Bunnymen are an English post-punk band, formed in Liverpool in 1978. The original line-up consisted of vocalist Ian McCulloch, guitarist Will Sergeant and bass player Les Pattinson, supplemented by a drum machine. By 1980, Pete de Freitas joined as the band's drummer, and their debut album, Crocodiles, met with critical acclaim and made the UK Top 20. Their second album, Heaven Up Here (1981), again found favour with the critics and reached number 10 in the UK Album chart. The band's cult status was followed by mainstream success in the mid-1980s, as they scored a UK Top 10 hit with \"The Cutter\", and the attendant album, Porcupine (1983), reached number 2 in the UK. Their next release, Ocean Rain (1984), continued the band's UK chart success, and has since been regarded as their landmark release, spawning the hit singles \"The Killing Moon\", \"Silver\" and \"Seven Seas\". One more studio album, Echo & the Bunnymen (1987), was released before McCulloch left the band to pursue a solo career in 1988. The following year, de Freitas was killed in a motorcycle accident, and the band re-emerged with a new line-up. Original members Will Sergeant and Les Pattinson were joined by Noel Burke as lead singer, Damon Reece on drums and Jake Brockman on keyboards. This new incarnation of the band released Reverberation in 1990, but the disappointing critical and commercial reaction it received culminated with a complete split in 1993.\n\nAfter working together as Electrafixion, McCulloch and Sergeant regrouped with Pattinson in 1997 and returned as Echo & the Bunnymen with the UK Top 10 hit \"Nothing Lasts Forever\". An album of new material, Evergreen, was greeted enthusiastically by critics and the band made a successful return to the live arena. Though Pattinson left the group for a second time, McCulloch and Sergeant have continued to issue new material as Echo & the Bunnymen, including the albums What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? (1999), Flowers (2001), Siberia (2005) and The Fountain (2009).",

They have played together since 1990 and released five studio albums: Asleep in the Back (2001), Cast of Thousands (2003), Leaders of the Free World (2005), The Seldom Seen Kid (2008) and Build a Rocket Boys! (2011). In the UK all of their albums have made the top twenty and seven of their singles have been in the top forty.\nIn 2008 they won the Mercury Music Prize for their album The Seldom Seen Kid and in November 2011 it was announced that they will be composing the BBC's 2012 Olympic coverage theme tune.\nLead singer Guy Garvey met guitarist Mark Potter at Stand College in 1990 at the age of 16. Potter asked Garvey to sing in a band he was in with drummer Richard Jupp and bassist Pete Turner. Together, the four men formed the band Mr Soft. (The name was later changed to Soft.) Mark Potter's brother Craig Potter joined the band soon after on keyboards. That year members of the band first played together at The Grants Arms pub in Ramsbottom, Bury, a borough of Greater Manchester).\nBy 1997, they had changed their name a third time to Elbow, after a line in the BBC TV drama The Singing Detective. A character (Philip Marlowe) says that the word \"elbow\" is the most sensuous word in the English language; not for its definition, but for how it feels to say it and how it looks on the page. The band signed a deal with Island Records, and recorded an album that was to be their debut, produced by Steve Osborne. However, when Island was bought out by major label Universal, the band was dropped in a mass cull and the album was never released.\nThey continued to record on the iconic independent label Ugly Man, and released The Noisebox EP, The Newborn EP, and The Any Day Now EP. This gained them extensive airplay by BBC Radio 1.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) were a British rock group from Birmingham who released eleven studio albums between 1971 and 1986 and another album in 2001. ELO were formed to accommodate Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical overtones. After Wood's departure following the band's debut record, Lynne wrote and arranged all of the group's original compositions and produced every album.\n\nDespite early singles success in the United Kingdom, the band were initially more successful in the United States, billed as \"The English guys with the big fiddles\". They soon gained a cult following despite lukewarm reviews back in their native United Kingdom. By the mid-1970s, they had become one of the biggest-selling acts in music. From 1972 to 1986, ELO accumulated 27 Top-40 hit singles in both the UK and the US. The group also scored 20 Top 20 UK hit singles, as well as 19 Top-20 hit singles in the US (as charted by Billboard Magazine). The band also holds the record for having the most Billboard Hot 100, Top 40 hits of any group in US chart history without ever having a number one single.\n\nELO collected 19 CRIA, 21 RIAA and 38 BPI awards, and sold over 50 million records worldwide during the group's active period of recording and touring.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 – June 15, 1996), also known as the \"First Lady of Song\", \"Queen of Jazz\", and \"Lady Ella\", was an American jazz and song vocalist. With a vocal range spanning three octaves (D♭3 to D♭6), she was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing and intonation, and a \"horn-like\" improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing.\nFitzgerald was a notable interpreter of the Great American Songbook. Over the course of her 59-year recording career, she was the winner of 13 Grammy Awards and was awarded the National Medal of Arts by Ronald Reagan and the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George H. W. Bush.\nFitzgerald was born in Newport News, Virginia, the daughter of William and Temperance \"Tempie\" Fitzgerald. The pair separated soon after her birth, and Ella and her mother went to Yonkers, New York, where they eventually moved in with Tempie's longtime boyfriend, Joseph Da Silva. Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances Da Silva, was born in 1923. She and her family were Methodists and were active in the Bethany African Methodist Episcopal Church, and she regularly attended worship services, Bible study, and Sunday School.\nIn her youth, Fitzgerald wanted to be a dancer, although she loved listening to jazz recordings by Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby and The Boswell Sisters. She idolized the lead singer Connee Boswell, later saying, \"My mother brought home one of her records, and I fell in love with it....I tried so hard to sound just like her.\"\nIn 1932, her mother died from a heart attack. Following this trauma, Fitzgerald's grades dropped dramatically, and she frequently skipped school. Abused by her stepfather, she was first taken in by an aunt and, at one point, worked as a lookout at a bordello and also with a Mafia-affiliated numbers runner. When the authorities caught up with her, she was first placed in the Colored Orphan Asylum in Riverdale, Bronx. However, when the orphanage proved too crowded, she was moved to the New York Training School for Girls in Hudson, New York, a state reformatory. Eventually she escaped and for a time was homeless.\nShe made her singing debut at 17 on November 21, 1934, at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York. She pulled in a weekly audience at the Apollo and won the opportunity to compete in one of the earliest of its famous \"Amateur Nights\". She had originally intended to go on stage and dance, but, intimidated by the Edwards Sisters, a local dance duo, she opted to sing instead in the style of Connee Boswell. She sang Boswell's \"Judy\" and \"The Object of My Affection,\" a song recorded by the Boswell Sisters, and won the first prize of US$25.00.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as \"the King of Rock and Roll\", or simply, \"the King\".\nPresley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, as a twinless twin, and when he was 13 years old, he and his family relocated to Memphis, Tennessee. His music career began there in 1954, when he recorded a song with producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who managed the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. He was regarded as the leading figure of rock and roll after a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement, made him enormously popular—and controversial.\nIn November 1956, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958, he was drafted into military service. He resumed his recording career two years later, producing some of his most commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and their accompanying soundtrack albums, most of which were critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii. Several years of prescription drug abuse severely damaged his health, and he died in 1977 at the age of 42.\nPresley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres, including pop, blues and gospel, he is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music, with estimated record sales of around 600 million units worldwide. He won three Grammys, also receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.",

In addition to his solo career, he is a member of D12 and (with Royce da 5'9\") half of the hip-hop duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem is the best-selling artist of the 2000s in the United States. Rolling Stone ranked him 83rd on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, calling him the King of Hip Hop. Including his work with D12 and Bad Meets Evil, Eminem has had ten number-one albums on the Billboard 200. He has sold more than 172 million albums, making him one of the world's best-selling artists. As of June 2014, Eminem is the second-bestselling male artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era, the sixth-bestselling artist in the United States and the bestselling hip-hop artist, with sales of 45.1 million albums and 42 million tracks (including 31 million digital single certifications).\nAfter his debut album Infinite (1996), Eminem achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with his The Slim Shady LP, which earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. His next two releases, 2000's The Marshall Mathers LP and 2002's The Eminem Show, were worldwide successes, with each being certified diamond in US sales and both winning Best Rap Album Grammy Awards—making Eminem the first artist to win the award for three consecutive LPs. They were followed by Encore in 2004, another critical and commercial success. Eminem went on hiatus after touring in 2005, releasing Relapse in 2009 and Recovery in 2010. Both won Grammy Awards and Recovery was the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide—the second time he had the international best-selling album of the year (after The Eminem Show). Eminem's eighth album, 2013's The Marshall Mathers LP 2, won two Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album; it expanded his record for the most wins in that category and his Grammy total to 15.\nEminem has developed other ventures, including Shady Records with manager Paul Rosenberg. He has his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio. In November 2002, Eminem starred in the hip hop film 8 Mile.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Engelbert Humperdinck ( 1 September 1854 – 27 September 1921) was a German composer, who wrote the opera Hansel and Gretel.\nHumperdinck was born at Siegburg in the Rhine Province in 1854. After receiving piano lessons, he produced his first composition at the age of seven. His first attempts at works for the stage were two singspiele written when he was 13. His parents disapproved of his plans for a career in music and encouraged him to study architecture. Nevertheless, he began taking music classes under Ferdinand Hiller and Isidor Seiss at the Cologne Conservatory in 1872. In 1876, he won a scholarship that enabled him to go to Munich, where he studied with Franz Lachner and later with Josef Rheinberger. In 1879, he won the first Mendelssohn Award given by the Mendelssohn Stiftung (foundation) in Berlin. He went to Italy and became acquainted with Richard Wagner in Naples. Wagner invited him to join him in Bayreuth, and during 1880 and 1881 Humperdinck assisted in the production of Parsifal. He also served as music tutor to Wagner's son, Siegfried.\nAfter winning another prize, Humperdinck traveled through Italy, France, and Spain and spent two years teaching at the Gran Teatre del Liceu Conservatory in Barcelona. In 1887, he returned to Cologne. He was appointed professor at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt in 1890 and also teacher of harmony at Julius Stockhausen's Vocal School. By this time he had composed several works for chorus and a Humoreske for small orchestra, which enjoyed a vogue in Germany.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Eric Patrick Clapton, CBE, (born 30 March 1945) is an English musician, singer and songwriter. He is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: once as a solo artist, and separately as a member of the Yardbirds and Cream. Clapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time. Clapton ranked second in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" and fourth in Gibson's \"Top 50 Guitarists of All Time\".\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Clapton departed from the Yardbirds to play blues with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. Immediately after leaving Mayall, Clapton joined Cream, a power trio with drummer Ginger Baker and bassist Jack Bruce in which Clapton played sustained blues improvisations and \"arty, blues-based psychedelic pop.\" For most of the 1970s, Clapton's output bore the influence of the mellow style of JJ Cale and the reggae of Bob Marley. His version of Marley's \"I Shot the Sheriff\" helped reggae reach a mass market. Two of his most popular recordings were \"Layla\", recorded by Derek and the Dominos, another band he formed, and Robert Johnson's \"Crossroads\", recorded by Cream. Following the death of his son Conor in 1991, Clapton's grief was expressed in the song \"Tears in Heaven\", which featured in his Unplugged album.\n\nA recipient of 17 Grammy Awards, and the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, in 2004 Clapton was awarded a CBE at Buckingham Palace for services to music. In 1998, Clapton, a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, founded the Crossroads Centre on Antigua, a medical facility for recovering substance abusers.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Born Erica Abi Wright on February 26, 1971 in Dallas, Texas, Erykah Badu inherited a taste for music from her mother Kolleen Wright, who introduced her to multiple genres of music (Joni Mitchell, Parliament-Funkadelic, Pink Floyd, Phoebe Snow, Chaka Khan). At the tender age of four, Badu began singing and dancing in productions at the local Dallas Theatre Centre. It wasn’t until her acting debut in the Martin Luther King Jr. Recreational Center’s musical production of “Really Rosie,” directed by her godmother Gwen Hargrove, that Badu realized she was a natural performer. “I played Alligator,” Badu says, “and at 6 years old, I got my first standing ovation. I knew I wanted to bring people to their feet from that point on. Badu stayed true to her artistic leanings and enrolled at Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing Arts in the late ’80s. Tomboyish and a bit of a class clown, Badu devoted most of her time to perfecting her dance form, studying the techniques of Martha Graham and Katherine Dunham, as well as practicing ballet, tap, and modern dance. Badu also sharpened her Hip-Hop skills, freestyling on the Dallas radio station 90.9 FM KNON under the name Apples the Alchemist until she eventually changed the spelling of her name from “Erica Wright” to “Erykah Badu,” “kah” being Kemetic (Egyptian) for a human’s vital energy or “inner-self” and “ba-du” after her favorite jazz scat-sound. But later, Badu would discover that her chosen name holds a far deeper meaning. Badu enrolled at Grambling State University, where she majored in theater and minored in Quantum Physics. She left in 1993 to pursue music full-time. During the day, she taught drama and dance at the South Dallas Cultural Center and worked as a coffeehouse waitress. At night, she recorded and performed songs like “Appletree,” produced by her cousin Robert “Free” Bradford. In 1994, her 19-song demo caught the attention of aspiring record executive Kedar Massenburg by way of the SXSW music festival. Massenburg signed her to his upstart label Kedar Entertainment. The company eventually merged with Motown/Universal and Badu started opening for D’Angelo, prepping the world for the massive Neo soul movement to come. The New York Times described Badu’s groundbreaking debut, 1997’s Baduizm, as “traditional soul vocals, staccato hip-hop rhythms and laid-back jazzy grooves.” Yet, hindsight reveals that Badu’s debut was more than just an album, it was the introduction of a new lifestyle. The music evoked speakeasies, incense, head wraps, and boho coffee shop culture all in one easy breath. Propelled by the lead single “On & On,” the album went multi-platinum, winning her two Grammys for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Album. Badu topped Rolling Stone’s Reader’s poll for Best R&B Artist, and Entertainment Weekly named her Best New Female Singer of 1997.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Exodus is an American thrash metal band formed in 1979 in Richmond, California. Their current lineup consists of guitarists Gary Holt and Lee Altus, bassist Jack Gibson, drummer Tom Hunting, and lead vocalist Steve \"Zetro\" Souza. There are no original members left in Exodus other than Hunting, who has departed from the band twice, in 1989 and 2004, but rejoined in 2007. Exodus is also notable for being guitarist Kirk Hammett's band before he left in 1983 to join Metallica as Dave Mustaine's replacement. Holt, who replaced original guitarist Tim Agnello in 1981, has been most consistent member throughout various lineup changes and break-ups, and is the only member to be present on each Exodus release. Much of the band's career has also been affected by bitter feuds between both band members and record companies, two extended hiatuses, deaths of former band members and internal problems often relating to drugs.\n\nSince its formation, Exodus has released ten studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, and a re-recording of their first album. Known as the kings of the Bay Area scene along with Metallica, they are often credited as pioneers of the Bay Area thrash metal scene, and have been referred to as one of the region's so-called \"big six\" alongside Testament, Death Angel, Lååz Rockit, Forbidden and Vio-lence. Exodus have sold over five million albums worldwide, and they are also considered to be one of the \"big eight\" of thrash metal, along with Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Testament, Overkill and Death Angel. The band had particular success in the mid-to-late 1980s with their first three studio albums: Bonded by Blood (1985), Pleasures of the Flesh (1987) and Fabulous Disaster (1989). The critical praise given to Fabulous Disaster garnered attention from major labels, including Capitol Records, with whom Exodus signed in 1989 and released two albums for the label: Impact Is Imminent (1990) and Force of Habit (1992). After a break up in 1994 and a short-lived reunion in 1997–1998, Exodus reunited once again in 2001, and since then, they have released five more studio albums, starting with and including Tempo of the Damned (2004), which reignited Exodus' popularity and is considered to be a key part in the early-to-mid-2000s thrash metal revival movement. The band's upcoming eleventh studio album, Persona Non Grata, is due for release on November 19, 2021.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "John David Jackson (born November 18, 1977 in Brooklyn, New York), better known by his stage name Fabolous, is a Grammy award nominated American rapper, actor and designer signed to Def Jam Records. He released his debut album, Ghetto Fabolous in 2001 and has since released 2003’s Street Dreams, 2004’s Real Talk and 2007’s From Nothin’ To Somethin’, all of which have collectively sold over four million copies in the United States. His fourth studio album, Loso’s Way, was released in July of 2009 and debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nIt takes talent to make the struggle to succeed seem effortless, but that is the gift that separates artists like Brooklyn’s John Jackson, aka Fabolous, from the everyday MC. While most rappers spend more and more time convincing the masses of their “hustle,” Fabolous lets his work speak for his effort. With two platinum albums (2001’s Ghetto Fabolous and 2003’s Street Dreams) and one Gold (2004’s Real Talk) to his credit, the veteran hitmaker still exudes a rookie-of-the year swagger. After recording for both Elektra and Atlantic Records, Fab is enjoying a home coming with the legendary Def Jam label. His first recorded song was “If They Want It” from DJ Clue’s The Professional, which was released by Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam in 1998.\n\n“I had people in my corner already over there,” Fab says of DJ Clue and A&R Skane, the Desert Storm duo who discovered Fabolous. “So it wasn’t like I was coming to a new neighborhood.”",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Fairport Convention played its first concert in a church hall in May 1967. Based in suburban north London, the group had coalesced around bass guitarist Ashley 'Tyger' Hutchings. \nThe youngsters 'convened' for rehearsals at a house named Fairport, the family home of rhythm guitarist Simon Nicol. Thus was born the name of a band that has endured for nearly four decades.\nAs well as Hutchings and Nicol, there was lead guitarist Richard Thompson and Shaun Frater on drums. \nHowever, that initial line-up only played the one gig. A young drummer, Martin Lamble, was in the church hall audience and he convinced the band that he could do a better job than the incumbent. It was the first of the bewildering flurry of line-up changes that characterised Fairport's first fifteen years. \nFairport soon augmented its line-up with a female singer, Judy Dyble, which set it apart from the dozens of other bands springing up from the fast-moving youth culture of that summer. \nFairport found no shortage of work and was soon a regular act at underground venues such as The Electric Garden, Middle Earth and UFO. \nThe band had only been playing a few months when they caught the ear of Joe Boyd who secured them a contract with Island Records. Boyd suggested they augment the line-up with another male vocalist and so Iain Matthews joined the band and the first album, Fairport Convention, came out before the end of 1967. \nAt this early stage, Fairport looked to America for material and inspiration. \"The two lead vocalist approach appealed to us,\" Matthews recalls. \"and because of our name and onstage presence, lots of people thought we were American, and we were not about to attempt to dispel that presumption.\" This led to the band being dubbed 'the British Jefferson Airplane'.\nBy the time the second LP, What We Did On Our Holidays, was released Judy Dyble had been replaced by Sandy Denny, a folk singer who had previously recorded as a soloist and with the Strawbs. \nThe third album, Unhalfbricking, featured a guest appearance by Birmingham folk fiddler Dave Swarbrick. This album, like its predecessor, mixed strong original material with contemporary songs by artists such as Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan. \nRadio DJ John Peel was a staunch champion of Fairport's music. He played the band's albums on his influential BBC shows. Peel also recorded a number of BBC sessions which were later released later as the album Heyday pictured.\nBy now the band was on the cusp of inventing folkrock, a hybrid of imaginative revivals of traditional material with modern instrumentation and rhythms. Richard Thompson had developed into an exceptionally talented and inventive guitarist, and the band was increasingly penning its own material.\nFairport Convention even entered the singles charts with Si Tu Dois Partir, a French language version of Bob Dylan's If You Gotta Go. The record just missed the top twenty but got the band a slot on Top Of The Pops (pictured left). \nThings were looking rosy when disaster struck. Fairport's van crashed on the M1 motorway on the way home from a gig in Birmingham. Martin Lamble - just 19 years old - and Jeannie Franklyn, Richard Thompson's girlfriend, were killed. The rest of the band suffered injuries of varying severity. \nThe young musicians nearly decided to call it a day. But they didn't and, once recovered, they went back into the studio. Matthews had left the band by then and Dave Mattacks took over the vacant drum stool. The resulting LP, Liege And Lief, was a classic. This was arguably Fairport Convention's finest album and established British folkrock as a distinct and influential genre. \nLiege And Lief was launched with a sell-out concert in London's Royal Festival Hall late in 1969. Dave Swarbrick had made a big contribution to the project and he now joined the band full-time.\nDespite the triumph of Liege And Lief, founder member Ashley Hutchings quit to form Steeleye Span. To compound Fairport's problems, Sandy Denny also left the band. \nDave Pegg took over on bass guitar and has been in the band ever since, an unbroken stint of 34 years. Sandy Denny was irreplaceable so the band decided to continue without a female singer. \nAll the band members and their families moved in to The Angel, a former pub in Hertfordshire. There was nearly another tragedy when a runaway lorry crashed into the building. Dave Swarbrick was rudely awoken as the truck demolished his bedroom, leaving him unhurt but covered in rubble. \nThe next Fairport album was Full House but soon after its release Richard Thompson left the band. Simon Nicol was now the only original member. \nThe band played on. Dave Swarbrick developed a folkrock opera called Babbacombe Lee and life in the ex-pub inspired the LP Angel Delight. The two albums were the first time the same Fairport line-up had recorded consecutively - every other release had seen changes in personnel from its predecessor. \nSimon Nicol left Fairport early in 1972, followed by Dave Mattacks although both would rejoin later. That left the two Daves, Pegg and Swarbrick, holding the band together. \nThe following few years were dubbed 'Fairport Confusion' as a bewildering sequence of band members came and went. Of the albums released during this period, Fairport Nine and Rosie were probably the most successful. \nIn 1974, Sandy Denny rejoined Fairport Convention for a couple of years. She is featured on the album Rising For The Moon but she left again in 1976.\nHaving come to the end of the contract with Island Records, Fairport signed up with Vertigo. By now, the line-up had stabilised and Simon Nicol was back in the band. But after two of four contracted albums, Vertigo wanted out - in fact, the label ended up paying Fairport Convention not to make albums. \nIn 1979 the band had no record deal and Dave Swarbrick's hearing was deteriorating rapidly. Fairport decided to call it a day. The band did a farewell tour and played a final outdoor concert in Cropredy, the Oxfordshire village where Dave and Christine Pegg lived. No record company wanted to release the live recordings of the tour and concert so the Peggs started Woodworm Records and released it themselves. \nAfter a year, Fairport Convention staged a re-union concert in Cropredy and the famous festival was born. Over the next few years, it grew rapidly. Soon Fairport was staging New Year gigs and playing in Scandinavia. The Peggs continued to record and release the Cropredy concerts as 'official bootlegs'. \nMeanwhile, Dave Pegg had joined Jethro Tull and Simon Nicol had teamed up with Dave Swarbrick in an acoustic duo. In 1985 both Pegg and Nicol had some spare time. Dave Mattacks (pictured left) was free too. They decided to record an album of new material in the Peggs' studio. \nDave Swarbrick declined to join the new band so violin virtuoso Ric Sanders, formerly of Soft Machine, was invited to participate. Multi-instrumentalist Maartin Allcock was also recruited and the five-piece recorded Fairport's only all-instrumental album Expletive Delighted. \nWith its mix of old stagers and new blood, this proved to be Fairport Convention's longest-lasting line-up - eleven years. \nIn the early nineties, a four-piece acoustic line-up emerged, the two versions of Fairport running in parallel. Woodworm continued to record and release the band's studio albums and live 'boots'. \nMaartin Allcock left in the mid-90s and was replaced by Chris Leslie on mandolin and fiddle. Chris proved to be a talented songwriter and has made a significant contribution to the band's repertoire. \nIn 1998, Dave Mattacks moved to the USA and Gerry Conway, who had travelled a parallel musical road to Fairport for 30 years, took over on drums and percussion.\nThe new century found Fairport in fine form. Concert halls were full and records were selling well. The year 2000 was marked by the very successful 'Y2K' tour and a new studio album, The Wood And The Wire.\nFree Reed Records, an independent label, released Fairport Unconventional, a four-CD boxed set of rare and unreleased recordings from the band's 35-year career in 2002.\nFairport Convention won the coveted Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2002 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. The seminal album Liege And Lief was voted 'Best Folk Album Ever' by Radio 2 listeners. In Summer 2006, Liege And Lief was awarded a Gold Disc for its continuing sales.\nFairport Convention is still one of the busiest bands around. The current line-up of Simon Nicol (lead vocal, rhythm and electric guitars), Dave Pegg (backing vocals, bass guitar, mandolin), Ric Sanders (violin), Chris Leslie (lead vocal, fiddle, bouzouki, mandolin) and Gerry Conway (percussion and drums) still packs venues on its frequent tours. \nEach year starts with Fairport covering the length and breadth of Britain on its Winter Tour. In August, the band stages Fairport's Cropredy Convention music festival in Oxfordshire. Most years, there is a tour in the USA and Canada and UK tours by the Fairport Acoustic line-up and by spin-off band The Dylan Project.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Faith No More is an American rock band from San Francisco, California, hailed as one of the most influential metal/rock bands of the late 80s and early 90s, and credited for inventing alternative metal and as an influence on nu metal. It was formed originally as Faith No Man in 1981 by bassist Billy Gould, keyboardist Wade Worthington, vocalist M Morris, and drummer Mike Bordin. A year later when Worthington was replaced by keyboardist Roddy Bottum, who along with Gould and Bordin, formed Faith No More. After going through a series of singers which included Courtney Love, the band was joined by Chuck Mosley in 1983. The same year, Jim Martin was recruited to replace guitarist Mark Bowen.\n\nFaith No More underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, We Care a Lot, in 1985. Within a year the band signed up with Slash Records, and in 1987 their second album Introduce Yourself was released. Membership remained stable until vocalist Mosley was replaced by Mike Patton in 1988. In 1989, the band released their highly successful album, The Real Thing, which featured their breakthrough hit single \"Epic\". The band's next album, 1992's Angel Dust, was also highly successful and spawned the hit \"MidLife Crisis\", which became their sole #1 hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in their career. Angel Dust is widely considered to be one of the most influential albums of the 90's. Faith No More however declined in popularity in the subsequent years. Longtime guitarist Jim Martin left the group in 1994 and was replaced by Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance. After the release of their next album, 1995's King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime, Spruance was replaced briefly by Dean Menta, who would eventually be replaced by their current guitarist Jon Hudson. After releasing one more album, Album of the Year, in 1997, Faith No More broke up in April 1998, and all members began work on side projects.\n\nOn February 24, 2009, Faith No More announced that they would be reforming for a European tour with the same lineup at the time of their breakup. In June 2009, they performed together for the first time in eleven years at the Brixton Academy in London, United Kingdom, as part of their The Second Coming Tour. Throughout 2010, the band continued to perform at multiple live venues. In September 2010, the band announced that the reunion tour would come to an end in December and plans for a new album had been scrapped, although bassist Billy Gould has said recently that the band might continue. Faith No More returned again in November 14th 2011 at the SWU Music and Arts Festival, in the Brazilian city of PaulÃ­nia, as well on three other dates. Trey Spruance joined the band onstage for the very first time to perform the King for a Day, Fool for a Lifetime album in its entirety in Santiago, Chile in November 2011.",

The keyboardist, Christine McVie, who joined the band in 1970 while married to John McVie, appeared on all but two albums, either as a member or as a session musician. She also supplied the artwork for the album Kiln House.\nThe two most successful periods for the band were during the late 1960s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist Peter Green and achieved a UK number one with \"Albatross\"; and from 1975 to 1987, with more pop-orientation, featuring Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac's second album after the incorporation of Nicks and Buckingham, 1977's Rumours, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles (including Nicks' song \"Dreams\", which was the band's first and only U.S. number one) and remained at No.1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks, as well as reaching the top spot in various countries around the world. To date the album has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the eighth highest selling album of all time.\nThe band enjoyed more modest success in the intervening period between 1971 and 1974, with the line-up including Bob Welch, and also during the 1990s which saw more personnel changes before the return of Nicks and Buckingham in 1997, and more recently, the departure of Christine McVie.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Foals are an indie rock band which formed in Oxford, England in 2005. They are currently signed to Transgressive Records in the United Kingdom and Sub Pop in the United States. They released their debut album Antidotes on 24 March 2008 in the UK, and 8 April 2008 in the US. The band’s second album, Total Life Forever, was released on 10 May 2010. Their third album is to be released in 2013. The band also released a mixtape named \"Tapes\" in July 2012.\n\nThe lead singer of Youthmovies, Andrew Mears, originally formed the band Foals, playing as guitarist and lead vocalist. He was present on the band’s debut single \"Try This on Your Piano/Look at My Furrows of Worry\", but left shortly afterwards to concentrate on Youthmovies’ debut album Good Nature.\n\nJack Bevan, Lina Simon and Yannis Philippakis were originally in cult math rock band The Edmund Fitzgerald, which did not gain much media interest. The group disbanded, claiming that things had become \"too serious\"  and that they wanted to have more \"fun making their music\".\n\nWalter Gervers and Jimmy Smith were part of a small Oxford band called Face Meets Grill. They met at and formed the band from members of Abingdon Boys School. They played gigs in and around Oxford, and recorded an EP in Hull. After playing Truck Festival in 2004 they separated to follow different paths and careers.\n\nGuitarist Jimmy Smith is the only one of the band members to have completed his degree, at Hull University: each of the band members quit their respective universities when the band signed to Transgressive Records by Ben Mackereth.\n\nThe band likes to be self-sufficient, so all of the music videos are created by their friend Dave Ma and all of the artwork (excluding cover art of Total Life Forever) is also done by their friend Tinhead.\n\nThe band’s musical influences are varied, with the band members citing minimal techno, Arthur Russell, the Irish based math rock band The Redneck Manifesto, Krautrock bands such as Harmonia, and Talking Heads as well For London (previously known as The Jester People) as their main sources of inspiration. Their musical style, however, can be more directly linked to various genres such as math rock, indie Rock or New rave.\n\nIn early 2007, the band released the limited edition 7\" singles Hummer and Mathletics, both produced by Gareth Parton. \"Hummer\" later featured on the Channel Four teen drama Skins.\n\nIn the summer of 2007 Foals began working on their debut album in New York. It was produced by Dave Sitek of TV On The Radio. However, the band decided to mix the album themselves, stating that Sitek made the first master copy of the album sound like it was recorded in the Grand Canyon. Yannis has stated multiple times during various interviews that Foals and Dave Sitek are on good terms, even though the copy by Sitek was rejected by the band. Foals released their debut album, entitled Antidotes, on 24 March 2008 in the UK and 8 April 2008 in the US. The album was a commercial success in the United Kingdom, debuting at No. 3 in the UK Albums Charts. The album was a minor success in other countries, charting in Japan, France and the Netherlands. Non-UK versions of the album include the early Parton produced singles.\n\nIn August 2009, Foals started recording their second album at Svenska Grammofon Studion in Gothenburg, Sweden. The album, Total Life Forever, has been described by the band members as sounding like \"tropical prog\" and \"like the dream of an eagle dying\". The band have described the album as being a lot less funk than they had originally planned. The album was produced by Luke Smith, formerly of Clor. The album’s title is named after an element of Ray Kurzweil’s theory of singularity. The band’s frontman Yannis Philippakis has professed a long time interest in futurology, with it informing numerous songs on Total Life Forever.\n\nOn 1 March 2010, the promotional single \"Spanish Sahara\" was first played on Zane Lowe’s show Radio 1. Foals’ new website was updated that night with the release of a video for the track directed by longtime collaborator Dave Ma. On 6 March, the Total Life Forever site was officially launched. Puzzles revealed images, lyrics and sound clips of songs from the album. The last clip appeared on 12 March, and resulted with a password entry for the Foals’ new website. The site was opened on 13 March and presented the whole new art concept and media including samples of songs, photos and videos. Lead single \"This Orient\" was released on 3 May 2010. The album was finally released on 10 May 2010.\n\n\"Spanish Sahara\"  was featured in trailers for Entourage s seventh season, season four of Skins, and BBC One s Outcasts. It was also used in the soundtrack of the second season of the E4 drama Misfits. It was released as a full physical single in September 2010, featuring an edited remix starring the strings of London Contemporary Orchestra.\n\nThe album was nominated for the 2010 Mercury Prize. In an interview with online magazine Coup De Main, Jimmy Smith said how the band members live together on and off the road - heading to Australia to record demos for their next album together. \"It’s just like touring with your family, it’s nice\".",

Prior to the release of the Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as fellow Nirvana touring bandmate Pat Smear as guitarist to complete the lineup. \nThe band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997) when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward. They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999).\nThe band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined as the band's lead guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album, One by One, in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, in 2007. In 2010, it was confirmed that Smear had officially rejoined the band after touring with the Foo Fighters as an unofficial member between 2006 and 2009. Over the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won 11 Grammy Awards winning Best Rock Album four times. The band's seventh studio album, Wasting Light, was released in 2011.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Foreigner is a rock band formed in New York City in 1976 by veteran musicians Mick Jones and ex-King Crimson member Ian McDonald, along with then-unknown vocalist Lou Gramm (Louis Grammatico). Foreigner has sold more than 50 million albums worldwide (including over 36 million in the United States alone).\n\n The band is led by British journeyman rocker Mick Jones (former member of Nero and The Gladiators, Spooky Tooth, and The Leslie West Band) who in early 1976 met with ex-King Crimson member Ian McDonald and formed Foreigner with Lou Gramm of Rochester, NY, as well as three other musicians who were all unknown at the time to form a sextet. \n\n The band’s debut album, Foreigner, sold more than four million copies in the United States and stayed in the top twenty for a year with such hits as “Feels Like the First Time,” “Cold as Ice,” and “Long Long Way From Home.” Their sophomore effort, Double Vision, topped their previous selling five million records and spawned “Hot Blooded” and title track “Double Vision.” The third album, Head Games, was also successful due to the thunderous “Dirty White Boy” and another title track hit “Head Games.” 1980 brought personnel changes so that now the band was a quartet and Rick Wills played bass. The departed members Gagliardi and Greenwood went on to the failed band Spys.\n\n Foreigner’s next album, their fourth and appropriately named 4, was their biggest hit containing “Jukebox Hero,” “Waiting for a Girl Like You,” and “Urgent.” Their next album, Agent Provocateur, gave them their only #1 hit, a gospel-inspired ballad backed by the New Jersey Mass Choir, “I Want To Know What Love Is.” The band then released Inside Information, but in the late 1980s Jones and Gramm each put out solo efforts and the band required personnel changes.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Francis Albert \"Frank\" Sinatra (December 12, 1915 - May 14, 1998) was an American singer and film actor. Beginning his musical career in the swing era with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey, Sinatra found unprecedented success as a solo artist from the early to mid-1940s after being signed to Columbia Records in 1943. Being the idol of the \"bobby soxers\", he released his first album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra in 1946. His professional career had stalled by the 1950s, but it was reborn in 1953 after he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in From Here to Eternity. He signed with Capitol Records in 1953 and released several critically lauded albums (such as In the Wee Small Hours, Songs for Swingin' Lovers!, Come Fly with Me, Only the Lonely and Nice 'n' Easy). Sinatra left Capitol to found his own record label, Reprise Records in 1961 (finding success with albums such as Ring-a-Ding-Ding!, Sinatra at the Sands and Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim), toured internationally, was a founding member of the Rat Pack and fraternized with celebrities and statesmen, including John F. Kennedy.\n\nSinatra turned 50 in 1965, recorded the retrospective September of My Years, starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music, and scored hits with \"Strangers in the Night\" and \"My Way\". With sales of his music dwindling and after appearing in several poorly received films, Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971. Two years later, however, he came out of retirement and in 1973 recorded several albums, scoring a Top 40 hit with \"(Theme From) New York, New York\" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally, until a short time before his death in 1998. Sinatra also forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning Best Supporting Actor in 1953, he also garnered a nomination for Best Actor for The Man with the Golden Arm, and critical acclaim for his performance in The Manchurian Candidate. He also starred in such musicals as High Society, Pal Joey, Guys and Dolls and On the Town.\n\nSinatra was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983 and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. He was the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Sinatra is also one of world’s best-selling artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million copies worldwide.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Frank Vincent Zappa (born December 21, 1940 in Baltimore, Maryland, United States – December 4, 1993 in Los Angeles, California, United States) was an American composer, guitarist, singer, bandleader and producer. He was one of the most prolific musicians of his time, releasing over fifty albums of original material spanning over a thirty-five year career.\n\nBorn on 21st December 1940 in Baltimore, Maryland, Zappa’s earliest influences were 1950s pop and rock (such as doo-wop and rhythm and blues), and 20th-century classical composers including Igor Stravinsky and Edgard Varèse. His output was divided between adventurous instrumental compositions and succinct, catchy rock songs with ribald, satirical, or comically absurd lyrics. On stage he demanded virtuosity and spontaneity from his musicians, and employed many performers who would later go on to achieve fame in their own rights. He directed and released a number of films featuring himself, his musicians and entourage, including 200 Motels and Baby Snakes.\n\nHis career started in 1955. His earliest recordings date from the mid-1960s, and include collaborations with his school friend Captain Beefheart. In 1965 he joined a bar-band called The Soul Giants, quickly dominating its musical direction and rechristening it The Mothers. Their first release (as The Mothers of Invention; the name alteration requested by their record company) was the 1966 double album Freak Out!. The line-up of the Mothers gradually expanded to accommodate Zappa’s increasingly ambitious and avant-garde music, but by 1969 he decided to work outside the band structure, focusing on his solo career, and effectively disbanding the Mothers in 1971.\n\nThe beginnings of his solo career in the late sixties and early seventies was characterised by a strong free jazz influence, with albums containing little, if any, lyrical content, such as Hot Rats, Waka/Jawaka and The Grand Wazoo. Towards the mid-seventies his albums became more rock-orientated, with a combination of jazz fusion instrumentation and rock song structures. This more accessible sound bore reasonable mainstream appeal, especially with the release of the well-advertised albums Over-Nite Sensation and Apostrophe (‘) (which both went Gold), but Zappa’s unpredictably eclectic output never led to solid mainstream recognition. He receieved uniformly lukewarm reviews from popular music publications such as Rolling Stone throughout his career. In his late seventies’ output, the gulf between his humorous songs and more lengthy, complex instrumental music widened, and albums, such as Zappa In New York, Joe’s Garage: Acts I, II & III, and Sleep Dirt displayed, by track, both sides firmly segregated.\n\nZappa saw a second run of success in the early eighties with the release of many albums with predominantly comedic rock songs, but later continued to experiment with virtually every style of music through the eighties, and was productive as ever until his death. His output in this later-career period included two albums of strikingly original classical music with the London Symphony Orchestra, an electronic take on 18th-century chamber music (written by the obscure Italian composer ‘Francesco Zappa’, no relation), an album of synclavier compositions (misleadingly titled Jazz From Hell which garnered a Grammy award), a double-CD release of electric guitar instrumental music (the laconically titled Guitar) and a plenitude of official live releases, revisiting fan-favourites as well as showcasing Zappa’s talent for reinventing the music of others; his version of Stairway To Heaven becoming a word-of-mouth favourite.\n\nZappa produced almost all of his own albums, spending many hours in the studio recording and manipulating tracks, and was always at the forefront of emerging technologies; from tape editing, collage, multitrack and overdubbing in the sixties to digital recording, electronic instruments and sampling in the eighties. Conversely, Zappa was also a obsessive self-archivist, recording virtually every one of his live performances, and often using live recordings of new material without needing to enter the studio. The archive of tapes at his family home in Los Angeles continues to be a source of posthumous releases for the Zappa Family Trust. He was also noted as a spotter of talent and his shifting line-up of musicians included Lowell George, Jean-Luc Ponty, Terry Bozzio, Chad Wackerman, George Duke, Mike Keneally, Adrian Belew and Steve Vai, as well as giving Alice Cooper his first break in music and working again with his old collaborator Captain Beefheart when his career was in decline.\n\nIn the late 1980s he became active in politics, campaigning against the PMRC’s music censorship scheme and acting as culture and trade representative for Czechoslovakia in 1989; and considered running as an independent candidate for president of the US.\n\nHis death in Los Angeles, California, on 4th December 1993 came three years after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Fugazi is an American post-hardcore band that formed in Washington, D.C. in 1987. The band's continual members are guitarists and vocalists Ian MacKaye and Guy Picciotto, bassist Joe Lally and drummer Brendan Canty.\nFugazi are noted for their DIY ethical stance, manner of business practice and contempt towards the music industry.\nFugazi have performed numerous worldwide tours, produced six studio albums, a film and a comprehensive live series, gaining the band critical acclaim and success around the world. Fugazi has been on indefinite hiatus since 2003.\n\nFugazi's music was an intentional departure from that of the hardcore punk bands the members had played in previously. Though clearly rooted in punk and hardcore, there is arguably more than punk to be found in Fugazi's music. Fugazi incorporated funk and reggae beats, irregular stop-start song structures, and heavy riffs inspired by popular rock bands such as Led Zeppelin and Queen, bands that the punk community of the time largely disdained. Also The Faith (Alec MacKaye's band, younger brother of Ian) and their 1983 EP Subject to Change had influence on Fugazi's music, at least in their first three albums.\nPicciotto became the group's second guitarist when he realized MacKaye's typically chunky, low-end riffs and Lally's dub-influenced basslines allowed him to focus on high-pitched parts. In both vocal and guitar roles, Picciotto assumed the role of a foil to MacKaye; employing a Rickenbacker guitar for its scratchy single-coil sound in order to \"cut through MacKaye's chunky chording like a laser beam.\" Picciotto's assumption of guitar duties allowed all four members of the band to jam together and write songs that way, where previously they had played songs largely as MacKaye had arranged them. When writing songs, the band often rearranges them with different structures and different singers. Spin Magazine has listed MacKaye and Picciotto together at No. 86 on their list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time for their unique and interlocking guitar style in Fugazi.\n\nGenerally, MacKaye's lyrics and singing are more direct and anthemic (MacKaye admits that he loves audience sing-alongs and writes songs with shout-able slogans), while Picciotto usually favors a more abstract, oblique approach. Lally has contributed vocals to a few songs as well, in which he sings in a more relaxed, quiet style as opposed to MacKaye and Picciotto, whose lyrics and vocals often feature strong emotional intensity. Later, Fugazi more fully integrated elements of punk rock, hardcore, soul and noise with an inventively syncopated rhythm section. Notable is MacKaye and Picciotto's inventive, interlocking guitar playing, which often defies the traditional notion of \"lead\" and \"rhythm\" guitars. They often feature unusual and dissonant chords and progressions filtered through a hardcore punk lens.\n\nWhen questioned by Guitar World in 2002 about the band's influences, singer/guitarist Ian MacKaye responded, \"Too many to mention. And not just from the last few years. Some of them predate us by decades, and most of them wouldn't be punk. I would hope any musician would be inspired by a lot of different kinds of music.\" Fugazi's guitar work has earned comparisons to Tom Verlaine's playing with New York art-punk icons Television and the early work of the UK's Gang of Four.\n\nEach of Fugazi's albums since Repeater have featured an instrumental song. By the time of 1995's Red Medicine bassist Joe Lally also began contributing vocals to the band and the group was implementing many of their broader influences into the overall sound. Critics Ian McCaleb and Ira Robbins declared that Fugazi's music combined an \"unprecedented dynamic range ... and previously unimagined elements\" such as \"clattering musique concrète ... piano and sound effects ... murky dub and lancing clarinet\" and \"loose-limbed jammy funk ... into an ambitious, experimental format that raises more stylistic questions than it answers.\"\n\nAfter the hardcore punk group Minor Threat dissolved, Ian MacKaye (vocals and guitar) was active with a few short-lived groups, most notably Embrace. MacKaye decided he wanted a project that was \"like the Stooges with reggae,\" but was wary about forming another band after Embrace's break up. MacKaye recalled, \"My interests were not necessarily to be in a band, but to be with people who wanted to play music with me.\"\n\nMacKaye recruited ex-Dag Nasty drummer Colin Sears and bass guitarist Joey Lally, and the trio began practicing together in September 1986. After a few months of rehearsals, Sears returned to Dag Nasty and was replaced by Brendan Canty (earlier of Rites of Spring). One day Canty's Rites of Spring bandmate Guy Picciotto dropped by during a practice session to see how his friend was getting along; he later admitted he secretly harbored the idea of joining the group. But Picciotto was disappointed that there seemed to be no place for him; he said, \"It seemed really completed already [. . .] It had a completely different feel from what I'd been doing with Brendan. It seemed just solid and done.\"\n\nAfter some uncertainty from Canty about what he wanted to do with his future, the trio regrouped and booked their first show at the Wilson Center in early September 1987. The group still needed a name, so MacKaye chose the word \"fugazi\" from Mark Baker's Nam, a compilation of stories of Vietnam War veterans, where it was used as slang for \"fucked up\", or, to be precise, an acronym for \"Fucked Up, Got Ambushed, Zipped In \".\n\nThe band began inviting Picciotto to practices. Inspired by use of a foil in hip hop, Picciotto sang backup vocals. After his band Happy Go Licky broke up, he became more involved with Fugazi. MacKaye eventually asked Picciotto to become a full member, which he accepted.\n\nFugazi embarked on its first tour in January 1988. In June 1988 the band recorded its debut EP Fugazi (or 7 Songs) with producer Ted Nicely and producer/engineer Don Zientara (who would become a long-time collaborator), and shortly afterwards embarked on an arduous tour of Europe.\n\nAt the tour's conclusion in December, the band recorded songs for its intended debut album. However, the band was spent from touring and decided that the resulting sessions were unsatisfactory. The tracklist was cut down to an EP and released as Margin Walker the following year. Both EPs were eventually combined into the 13 Songs release in late 1989. Upon the band's return from Europe, Picciotto, unsatisfied with merely singing, began playing guitar.\n\nWith Picciotto now playing guitar full-time, Fugazi had made the transition into jamming on and writing new material as a band as opposed to performing songs composed solely by singer/guitarist MacKaye. In addition to working on new material, songs that they had already been performing live were refined such as \"Merchandise\" and \"Turnover\" for inclusion on their first official full-length studio album.\n\nReleased on April 19, 1990 through Dischord Records, Repeater did not initially reach the Billboard 200 charts or become a commercial success. However, the band spent most of 1990 and 1991 touring heavily behind Repeater, performing a total of 250 concerts between March 1990 and June 1991, routinely selling out 1,000+ capacity venues all over the world. By summer 1991 the album had sold more than 300,000 copies, a large number for a label that relied on minimal promotion. While major labels began to court Fugazi, the band decided that Dischord was distributing their records well enough and refused the offers. Repeater went on to sell over 1 million copies in the US alone, and has sold more than 2 million worldwide. The album was also critically well received and featured an alternative rock sound that pre-dated significant releases such as Nirvana's Nevermind and Pearl Jam's Ten, which would unexpectedly go on to break the genre into the mainstream.\n\nFor Fugazi's second studio-album Steady Diet of Nothing, released in July 1991, the band once again asked Ted Nicely to produce. Nicely had become a chef and had to reluctantly turn down the job, so the band members decided to produce the record themselves. After the success of Repeater and its subsequent world tour, Steady Diet was highly anticipated, six months prior to its release Dischord had pre-orders in excess of 160,000 for the album.\n\nFugazi recorded its third album In on the Kill Taker in the fall of 1992 with Steve Albini in Chicago; however, the results were deemed unsatisfactory and the band re-recorded the album with Ted Nicely & Don Zientara. With the breakthrough of alternative rock in the early 1990s, In on the Kill Taker; released on June 30, 1993, became the group's first record to enter the Billboard album charts, received critical praise from Spin, TIME magazine and Rolling Stone, sold 180,000 copies in its first week of release and subsequently became the band's breakthrough album.\n\nBy the In on the Kill Taker tour, the group began to sell-out large auditoriums and arenas, as well as receive more lucrative major label offers. During the bands sold-out 3-night stint at New York City's Roseland Ballroom in September 1993, music mogul and Atlantic Records president Ahmet ErtegÃ¼n met with the band backstage in an attempt to sign them. ErtegÃ¼n offered the band \"anything you want\", their own subsidiary label and more than $10 million just to sign with Atlantic. Fugazi declined the offer. The organizers of Lollapalooza also attempted to recruit the band for a headlining slot on its 1993 tour, which the band considered but ultimately turned down.\n\nFugazi began writing the material for Red Medicine in late 1994, after touring in support of In on the Kill Taker. The band worked with engineer Don Zientara, but did not choose to work with producer Ted Nicely again. Fugazi opted to retreat from the in-your-face production values of In on the Kill Taker and instead worked to create an ambient sound which would display greater range and depth. To achieve this, the band handled production duties themselves, and in doing so, became more confident with in-studio experimentation. Red Medicine would take Fugazi a step further toward art rock. The band began an extensive worldwide tour in support of the album, playing a total of 172 shows between March 1995 and November 1996.\n\nAfter the grueling worldwide tour the band had completed in support of Red Medicine, Fugazi took an extended break and also began writing material for a follow up release. By March 1997 Fugazi had once again returned to Inner Ear Studios with producer/engineer Don Zientara to begin recording what would become the End Hits album with the intention of taking a more relaxed approach to recording and a longer amount of time to experiment with different songs and techniques in the studio. The group ultimately spent 7 months recording the album. Due to the title, rumors began circulating at the time that it was to be the their last release. Released on April 28, 1998 the album was commercially successful and marked one of the band's highest debuts yet on the Billboard charts. However, critical reaction to End Hits was mixed. Many critics praised the album's heavier tracks, while others questioned the inclusion of the group's longer, more experimental songs.\n\nFugazi began work on the The Argument in 1999. This process saw the group taking more time than usual to write and demo material. Each member would bring their own individual riffs and ideas to the band, jam on them, and then begin piecing the songs together into various configurations before deciding on what would become the final versions. The album's recording sessions took place between January and April 2001 at Inner Ear Studios and Dischord House in Arlington, VA, located just outside of Washington D.C. The band once again worked with producer/engineer Don Zientara. During the recording process a considerable amount of time was spent finalizing each songs production, in particular the album's drum tracks, in an effort to give it a unique feel. Drummer Brendan Canty explained to Modern Drummer that \"We recorded them all very differently in terms of the drum sounds. We used a lot of different drum kits, cymbals, snares, and miking techniques.\n\nThe Argument was released by Dischord Records on October 16, 2001, along with the EP Furniture + 2, almost 4 years after the release of End Hits. The album was met with critical and commercial success entering the Billboard charts and selling over 170,000 copies in its first week of release. Arion Berger of Rolling Stone called the album \"bracing\" and \"intellectual\" and Chris True of AllMusic referred to the album as \"spine-tingling and ear-shattering all at once\" stating that, \"the band has raised the bar for themselves and others once again.\" He also noted that the album had \"touched on strange new territory.\" By this point Fugazi were on tour less frequently, due in large part to other professional and personal commitments, they performed only 32 shows in 2001 and 2002 respectively.\n\nFugazi went on what they have called an \"indefinite hiatus\" after the conclusion of their 2002 UK tour following 3 sold-out nights at the London Forum in England on November 2, 3, 4, 2002. The hiatus was brought on by the band members' insistence on spending more time with their families and to pursue other professional projects.\n\nSince Fugazi went on hiatus in 2003, rumors began circulating regarding a possible reunion, with some insinuating that the band may get back together to headline the Coachella Festival in Indio, CA. While the band has confirmed that they have been offered large sums of money to reunite and headline festivals, such as Coachella, they have so far, declined the offers.\n\nAs recently as March 2011, MacKaye reiterated that Fugazi has \"been offered insane amounts of money to play reunions, but it’s not going to be money that brings us back together, we would only play music together if we wanted to play music together and time allowed it\".\n\nIn November 2011, when asked by the AV Club about the possibility of a reunion and a follow up to 2001's The Argument, bassist Joe Lally stated that \"The Argument was a great record that we should try and top. It’ll take some time to come together and everything. To do that, we’d have to, the way the four of us are, we would take quite some time, I think, re-associating ourselves musically, and then just letting it come about naturally, because it would have to be a natural thing. So we’ll just see.\"",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The group that would become Funkadelic was originally formed by George Clinton in 1964, as the unnamed musical backing for his doo wop group The Parliaments while on tour. The band originally consisted of musicians Frankie Boyce, Richard Boyce, and Langston Booth plus the five members of the Parliaments on vocals. Boyce, Boyce, and Booth enlisted in the Army in 1966, and Clinton recruited bassist Billy Bass Nelson and guitarist Eddie Hazel in 1967, then also added guitarist Tawl Ross and drummer Tiki Fulwood. The band name \"Funkadelic\" was coined by Nelson after the band relocated to Detroit. By 1968, because of a dispute with Revilot, the record company that owned the name \"The Parliaments,\" the ensemble began playing under the name Funkadelic.\n\nAs Funkadelic, the group signed to Westbound in 1968. Around this time, the group's music evolved from soul and doo wop into a harder guitar-driven mix of psychedelic rock, soul and funk, much influenced by the popular musical (and political) movements of the time. Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone were major inspirations. This style later evolved into a tighter guitar-based funk (circa 1971-75), which subsequently, during the height of Parliament-Funkadelic success (circa 1976-81), added elements of R&B and electronic music, with fewer psychedelic rock elements.\n\nThe group's self-titled debut album, Funkadelic, was released in 1970. The credits listed organist Mickey Atkins plus Clinton, Fulwood, Hazel, Nelson, and Ross. The recording also included the rest of the Parliaments singers (still uncredited due to contractual concerns), several uncredited session musicians then employed by Motown, as well as Ray Monette (of Rare Earth) and future P-Funk mainstay Bernie Worrell.\n\nBernie Worrell was officially credited starting with Funkadelic's second album, 1970s Free Your Mind... and Your Ass Will Follow, thus beginning a long working relationship between Worrell and Clinton. The album Maggot Brain followed in 1971. The first three Funkadelic albums displayed strong psychedelic influences (not least in terms of production) and limited commercial potential, despite containing many songs that stayed in the band's setlist for several years and would influence many future funk, rock, and hip hop artists.\n\nAfter the release of Maggot Brain, the Funkadelic lineup was expanded greatly. Tawl Ross was unavailable after experiencing either a bad LSD trip or a speed overdose, while Billy Bass Nelson and Eddie Hazel quit due to financial concerns. From this point, many more musicians and singers would be added during Funkadelic's (and Parliament's) history, including the recruitment of several members of the famous James Brown backing band The JB's in 1972 - most notably Bootsy Collins and the Horny Horns. Bootsy and his brother Catfish Collins were recruited by Clinton to replace the departed Nelson and Hazel. Bootsy in particular become a major contributor to the P-Funk sound. In 1972, this new line-up released the politically charged double album America Eats Its Young. The lineup stabilized a bit with the album Cosmic Slop in 1973, featuring major contributions from recently added singer-guitarist Garry Shider. After first leaving the band, Eddie Hazel spent a year in jail for drug possession and assault, then returned to make major contributions to the 1974 album Standing on the Verge of Getting It On. Hazel only contributed to P-Funk sporadically thereafter.\n\nGeorge Clinton revived Parliament in 1974 and signed that act to Casablanca Records. Parliament and Funkadelic featured mostly the same stable of personnel but operated concurrently under two names. At first, Parliament was designated as a more mainstream funk ensemble dominated by soulful vocals and horn arrangements, while Funkadelic was designated as a more experimental and freestyle guitar-based funk band. The ensemble usually toured under the combined name Parliament-Funkadelic or simply P-Funk (which also became the catch-all term for George Clinton's rapidly growing stable of funk artists).\n\nIn 1975 Michael Hampton, a teen guitar prodigy, replaced Hazel as the premier lead guitarist in Parliament-Funkadelic, and was a major contributor to the next several Funkadelic albums. Funkadelic left Westbound in 1976 and moved to Warner Brothers. Their first album for Warner was Hardcore Jollies in 1976. Just before leaving Westbound, Clinton provided that label with a collection of recently recorded outtakes, which Westbound released as the album Tales of Kidd Funkadelic. That album did significantly better commercially than Hardcore Jollies and included \"Undisco Kidd\", an R&B Top 30 single. In 1977, Westbound capitalized further by releasing the anthology The Best of the Early Years.\n\nAs Parliament began achieving significant mainstream success in the 1975-1978 period, Funkadelic recorded and released its most successful and influential album, One Nation Under a Groove in 1978, adding former Ohio Players keyboardist Walter \"Junie\" Morrison and reflecting a more melodic dance-based sound. The title track spent six weeks at #1 on the R&B charts, around the time that Parliament was enjoying the #1 R&B singles \"Flash Light\" and \"Aqua Boogie\". Uncle Jam Wants You in 1979 continued Funkadelic's new more electronic sound production. The album contains the fifteen-minute \"(Not Just) Knee Deep\" featuring former Spinners lead singer Philippé Wynne, an edited version of which topped the R&B charts. The final official Funkadelic album, The Electric Spanking of War Babies, was released in 1981. The release was originally a double-album project, but it was reduced to a single disc under pressure from Warner Brothers. Some of the deleted tracks would appear on future P-Funk releases, most notably the 1982 hit single \"Atomic Dog\" which appeared on the first George Clinton solo album.\n\nMeanwhile, the album Connections & Disconnections (re-issued on CD as Who's a Funkadelic) was released under the name Funkadelic in 1981. The album was recorded by former Funkadelic members and original Parliaments Fuzzy Haskins, Calvin Simon, and Grady Thomas, who had left P-Funk in 1977 after disagreements with George Clinton's management practices. This LP, notable for its heavy use of Thomas \"Pae-dog\" McEvoy's jazz horn, contains the track called \"You'll Like It Too\", which came a very popular breakbeat source for the Hip hop community in the 80s. Another rebellious former band member, drummer Jerome Brailey, released the album Mutiny on the Mamaship, by his new band Mutiny. Even Clinton himself found this to be a good album despite containing lyrics that mocked him and his management of the P-Funk enterprise.\n\nIn the early 1980s, with legal difficulties arising from the multiple names used by multiple groups, as well as a shakeup at Parliament's record label, George Clinton dissolved Parliament and Funkadelic as recording and touring entities. However, many of the musicians in later versions of the two groups remained employed by Clinton. Clinton continued to release new albums regularly, sometimes under his own name and sometimes under the name George Clinton & the P-Funk All-Stars. In the mid-1980s, the last Funkadelic album By Way Of The Drum was recorded by Clinton with P-Funk personnel and many electronic devices. The album was rejected by its record label and did not see official release in America until it appeared as a reissue in 2007. It features a cover of \"Sunshine Of Your Love\" by Cream. The album did not receive any publicity, but still received favorable reviews.\n\nClinton continued his P-Funk collective in the 1990s and 2000s, with a revolving stable of musicians, some of whom remain from the classic lineups of Funkadelic and Parliament. The rock-oriented sound of Funkadelic has diminished, as Clinton has moved towards more of an R&B and hip hop sound. In 1997 the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nFilmmaker Yvonne Smith of New York City-based Brazen Hussy productions produced Parliament-Funkadelic: One Nation Under a Groove, a full-length documentary about the groundbreaking group, which aired on PBS in 2005. As of 2008, Clinton was at work on a new Funkadelic album for his new record label. In November 2008, Westbound Records released Toys, a collection of Funkadelic outtakes and demos from the Free Your Mind and America Eats Its Young era. Critical reception of the album has generally been positive. In April 2013, the band released their first single in over 25 years when they released \"The Naz\". The song is a collaboration with Sly Stone and tells the story of Jesus Christ. The B-side to the song is \"Nuclear Dog\" which is guitar solo by former P-Funk guitarist Dewayne \"Blackbird\" McKnight.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Genesis are an English rock band that formed in 1967. The band consists of its three longest-tenured members - Tony Banks (keyboards) and Mike Rutherford (bass, guitar), who were founding members; and Phil Collins (vocals, drums), who first joined in 1970. Past members Peter Gabriel (vocals, flute), Steve Hackett (guitar) and Anthony Phillips (guitar) also played major roles in the band in its early years. Genesis are among the top 30 highest-selling recording artists of all time, with approximately 150 million albums sold worldwide.\nIn the late 1960s, with the release of their first album, Genesis's music was initially regarded by the band and the fans as a pop experiment, referring to then-popular melodic pop. Then, over the course of a year, (beginning with their second album in mid-1970) they quickly evolved into a progressive rock band with the incorporation of complex song structures and elaborate instrumentation. Their concerts became theatrical experiences with innovative stage design, pyrotechnics, extravagant costumes and on-stage stories. This second phase was characterised by lengthy performances such as the 23-minute \"Supper's Ready\" and the 1974 concept album, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. In the late '70s and early '80s the band's musical direction changed once again, becoming more pop oriented and commercially accessible. This resulted in their first top 40 single in the US with \"Follow You Follow Me\", their first number one album in the United Kingdom, Duke, and their only number one single in the United States, \"Invisible Touch\".\nGenesis has undergone several personnel changes throughout its history. Stage fright forced founding member Anthony Phillips to leave the band in 1970. In 1975, Collins, then the band's drummer, replaced Peter Gabriel as lead singer after a lengthy search for a replacement. To facilitate Collins's move to lead vocals during concerts, Bill Bruford and Chester Thompson played drums for the band as they toured, with Collins joining in briefly during lengthy instrumental passages. In 1977, guitarist Steve Hackett left the band. After Phil Collins left the band in 1996, Genesis recruited Ray Wilson (formerly of Stiltskin). Wilson appeared on the 1997 album Calling All Stations, after which the band announced an indefinite hiatus. In 2007, Banks, Collins and Rutherford reunited for a 20-city tour of Europe and North America, which included a free concert at Rome's Circo Massimo in front of 500,000 fans. Genesis were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. The future of the band remains uncertain with Collins's retirement from the music business and the other members' solo work.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Elgin Baylor Lumpkin (born October 15, 1970), better known by his stage name Ginuwine is an American singer-songwriter dancer and actor. Signed to Epic Records since the mid-1990s, Ginuwine had released a number of multi-platinum and platinum-selling albums and singles, becoming one of R&B's top artists during the late 1990s and early 2000s .\n\nLeon Youngblood, manager of one of the vocalists featured on the album, told George Varga in an interview with the Union Tribune Newspaper that the album \"was supposed to be billed as a 'Ginuwine Presents' album\" \" Youngblood stated \"the album did very well, it's the first time I worked with anyone who cracked #50 on the billboard charts, I'm very proud of that fact.\"\n\nGinuwine can be spotted in one of Jodeci's videos. He, later, sang the chorus on Danny Boy's \"Slip N Slide\". There, he met rapper Melissa \"Missy\" Elliott and producer Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley, who became his main collaborators through the 1990s. Ginuwine's first single, (written by Static Major) the 1996 \"Pony\" from Ginuwine...The Bachelor, showcased his smooth vocals and Timbaland's innovative production style, and the two became a hit-making duo. The song \"Pony\" was used in a \"karaoke\" scene from the film Wild Hogs in 2007 and again used in the video game Grand Theft Auto IV in 2008. Mike Patton and Rahzel together perform a cover of \"Pony\" during their concerts. Ginuwine covered Prince's \"When Doves Cry\" single from the movie soundtrack to Purple Rain.\n\nAfter his second album, 100% Ginuwine, was released in 1999, Ginuwine and Timbaland grew apart. Producers such as R. Kelly have crafted hits for him since then. In 2001, Ginuwine had a number-four hit on the Billboard Hot 100 with the single \"Differences\", which also peaked at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart.\n\nWithin a year, Ginuwine lost both of his parents. He later wrote a song which is featured on his album The Life entitled \"Two Reasons I Cry\". In 2002, Ginuwine was a feature artist on P. Diddy's number-one hit \"I Need a Girl (Part II)\". Later that year, Ginuwine started his own label, Bag Entertainment. The label would feature artists such as Jose Cenquentez (who appeared on The Senior) and Knight.\n\nGinuwine's fifth album, Back II Da Basics, was released on November 15, 2005. The album debuted at number 12 on the Billboard 200, selling close to 100,000 copies. Ginuwine stated on BET's Top 100 countdown that the album went Gold with sales of 500,000 copies.\n\nIn May 2007, an album entitled I Apologize was released in stores. Although attributed to Ginuwine, the release was an unauthorized album and included only three Ginuwine songs - apparently from stolen masters - and ten songs by other artists. Ginuwine spoke against the unofficial release on both his MySpace page and through YouTube. In 2007, Ginuwine collaborated with Canadian hip-hop artist Belly in the latter's debut solo song \"Pressure\", which was featured in Belly's debut album the Revolution, released in June 2007.\n\nGinuwine's sixth album entitled A Man's Thoughts, was released on June 23, 2009. The album was produced by The Underdogs, B Cox, Timbaland, The Runners, Johnta Austin, Oak and Polow Da Don. The album includes guests appearances from Brandy, Missy Elliott, Bun B and Timbaland.[17] Ginuwine formed a group with Tank and Tyrese named TGT. Their first single was a remix of Tank's \"Please Don't Go\". They were supposed to tour but plans fell apart due to conflicting schedules.[18]\n\nGinuwine announced on his Myspace Blog on August 21, 2008 that due to label and legal issues, they will not be able to release an official TGT album.[19] Ginuwine is the founder and CEO of LoveSong Incorporated, after completing his contract with 550 Music/Epic. Ginuwine announced on his Myspace blog on August 21, 2008 that he signed a major label deal with Notifi Records/Warner Brothers.[19]\n\nGinuwine introduced producer MELROG and rapper Young Knight a.k.a. Knightron on the Back 2 Da Basics album. Currently Knightron is working on his own album under Ginuwine's label BAG ENT. Elgin will be released on Valentine's Day 2011.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Gladys Knight & The Pips were an R&B/soul family musical act from Atlanta, Georgia, active from 1953 to 1989. The group was best known for their string of hit singles on Motown's \"Soul\" record label and Buddah Records from 1967 to 1975, including \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" (1967) and \"Midnight Train to Georgia\" (1973). The longest-lived incarnation of the act featured Gladys Knight on lead vocals, with The Pips, who included her brother Merald \"Bubba\" Knight and their cousins Edward Patten and William Guest, as backup singers. Gladys Knight was born in 1944 in Atlanta, Georgia. At the age of seven in 1952, she won Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour television show contest. The following year, she, her brother Bubba, sister Brenda, and their cousins William and Eleanor Guest started a singing group called \"The Pips\" (named after another cousin, James \"Pip\" Woods). The Pips began to perform and tour, eventually replacing Brenda Knight and Eleanor Guest with cousins Langston George and Edward Patten in 1959.\nThe Pips scored their first hit in 1961 with \"Every Beat of My Heart\", a cover of a Hank Ballard & The Midnighters song written by Johnny Otis. The group had recorded the song for a friend in Atlanta, who promptly sold the master to Vee-Jay Records and cut the group out of the record's profits. The Pips recorded a second version of \"Every Beat\" with Bobby Robinson as the producer, and the song became a #1 R&B and #6 pop hit. Shortly afterwards, Langston George left the group, and the remaining members continued as a quartet, now billed as Gladys Knight & the Pips. Typically, most of the act's recordings featured Knight's contralto on lead vocals and the three male members of the group, usually referred to as \"The Pips\" by themselves, providing characteristic background vocals.\nAfter a second Vee-Jay hit, \"Letter Full of Tears\", in 1962, Knight quit the group to start a family with husband James Newman, giving birth to James Gaston Newman III in August of that year. Her second child Kenya Maria Newman was born in November the following year. The Pips toured on their own for two years, until Knight returned to the act in 1964 in order to support her two children.\nThe group developed a reputation for exciting and polished live performances that enabled them to work even without the benefit of best-selling records. Choreographer Cholly Atkins designed \"fast-stepping\" dance routines that became a signature of the Pips' stage presentation.",

The first album from 1977 was entitled Live Again Renacer and was released with two different covers. After several more releases on the Audiofon label as well as the RCA Victor label and Miami Sound Machine's own label MSM Records, the band was signed to Discos CBS International and released several albums, 45s, and 12\"s beginning with 1980s self-titled album Miami Sound Machine. Growing in popularity in both the United States and around the world, the group would continue recording and issuing various works for Discos CBS International through 1985. In 1984, Miami Sound Machine released their first Epic/Columbia album, Eyes of Innocence, which contained the dance hit \"Dr. Beat\" as well as the ballad \"I Need Your Love\". Their more successful follow-up album Primitive Love was released in 1985 launching three Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100: \"Conga\" (U.S. #10), \"Words Get In The Way\" (U.S. #5), and \"Bad Boy\" (U.S. #8) became follow up hits in the U.S. and around the world. \"Words Get in the Way\" reached #1 on the US Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, establishing that the group could perform pop ballads as successfully as dance tunes.

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Goo Goo Dolls are an American rock band formed in 1985 in Buffalo, New York, by vocalist and guitarist John Rzeznik and vocalist and bass guitarist Robby Takac. Since the end of 1994, Mike Malinin has been the band's drummer, a position previously held by George Tututska. Although renowned for their commercially successful 1998 single \"Iris\", they have had several other notable and popular singles include \"Name\" from 1995's A Boy Named Goo, \"Broadway\", \"Black Balloon\" and \"Slide\" from 1998's Dizzy Up The Girl, which produced five top-10 singles, and \"Here Is Gone\", \"Sympathy\" and \"Big Machine\" from 2002's Gutterflower. The Goo Goo Dolls have 14 top-10 singles and have sold more than ten million albums worldwide.\n\nThe band's original line-up included John Rzeznik (vocals, guitar), Robby Takac (vocals, bass guitar) and George Tutuska (drums, percussion). In the beginning, John would not sing, due to his shyness. Takac and Tutuska had been long-time friends in school and met Rzeznik while he was playing in the band The Beaumonts with Takac’s cousin. The trio picked their name from a True Detective ad for a toy called a Goo Goo Doll. \"We were young and we were a garage band not trying to get a deal. We had a gig that night and needed a name. It's the best we came up with, and for some reason it stuck. If I had had five more minutes, I definitely would have picked a better name\" John stated. With Takac as their lead singer, the band released their first album, Goo Goo Dolls in 1987 on Mercenary Records, but was picked up in 1988 by Celluloid Records, a larger record company. They would play around Buffalo's underground music circuit opening for punk bands such as SNFU, Dag Nasty, ALL, and DRI and playing with fellow Buffalo bands. The band released its second album, Jed, in 1989 after moving to Los Angeles.\n\nThe band released its third album, Hold Me Up, in 1990 and featured Rzeznik as the lead vocalist on five tracks, including the single, \"There You Are\" - as well their then concert favorite, Two Days in February. Despite being earlier dismissed as having a sound too similar to The Replacements, as well as being embraced by local college radio and punk scenes (including playing such venues as CBGB), the Goo Goo Dolls' third release had incorporated elements of heavy metal, pop rock, and punk rock. In 1991, the song \"I'm Awake Now\" was recorded for the soundtrack of Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare.\n\nSuperstar Car Wash, released in 1993, received significant media attention. The critical success and encouraging sales of their last album resulted in a larger budget from Metal Blade Records. The album was partially recorded in Metalworks Studio in Mississauga, Ontario. \"We Are the Normal\" (the single for which Rzeznik asked frontman Paul Westerberg of The Replacements to write the lyrics), received a major push toward play on college and independent radio, while its video was displayed on MTV's 120 Minutes program. \"Fallin' Down\" made it onto the 1993 soundtrack of Pauly Shore's hit film Son in Law.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Gorillaz are an English virtual band created in 1998 by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. The band consists of four animated members: 2D (lead vocals, keyboard), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar, keyboard, and backing vocals) and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). These members are completely fictional and are not personas of any \"real life\" musicians involved in the project. Their fictional universe is explored through the band's website and music videos, as well as a number of other media, such as short cartoons. The music is a collaboration between various musicians, with Albarn being the only permanent musical contributor. Writers and critics have described their music as alternative rock, Britpop, trip hop, hip hop, electronica, indie, dub, reggae and pop.\nThe band's 2001 debut album Gorillaz sold over seven million copies and earned them an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records as the Most Successful Virtual Band. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2001, but the nomination was later withdrawn at the band's request. Their second studio album, Demon Days, released in 2005, went five times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the US, earned five Grammy Award nominations for 2006 and won one of them in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals category. The band has won numerous other awards, including two MTV Video Music Awards, an NME Award, three MTV Europe Music Awards, and have been nominated for nine Brit Awards. The combined sales of the Gorillaz and Demon Days albums had exceeded 15 million by 2007. The band's third studio album, Plastic Beach, was released in March 2010. Their latest album, The Fall, was released in December 2010 as a free download for fan club members, then in April 2011 as a physical release. Gorillaz plan to release new material in 2016.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Gram Parsons is the father of country-rock. With the International Submarine Band, the Byrds, and the Flying Burrito Brothers, the songwriter pioneered the concept of a rock band playing country music, and as a solo artist he moved even further into the country realm, blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other. While he was alive, Parsons was a cult figure that never sold many records but influenced countless fellow musicians, from the Rolling Stones to the Byrds. In the years since his death, his stature has only grown, as numerous rock and country artists build on his small, but enormously influential, body of work.\nGram Parsons was born Cecil Ingram Connor on November 5, 1946. He was the grandson of John Snivley, who owned roughly one-third of all the citrus fields in Florida, and the son of Coon Dog Connor, an Air Force veteran who owned a box-making factory in Waycross, Georgia. As a child, Parsons learned how to play the piano at the age of nine, the same year he saw Elvis Presley perform at his school; following the seminal performance, Parsons decided to become a musician. When he was 12, Parsons' father committed suicide, and the family moved in with Parsons' grandparents in Winter Haven, FL. A year after the move, his mother married Robert Parsons; Gram was then adopted by his stepfather, and the child legally changed his name to Gram Parsons.\nAt the age of 14, Parsons began playing in the local rock & roll band the Pacers, which evolved into the Legends. During its time together, the Legends featured Jim Stafford and Kent Lavoie, who would later come to fame under the name Lobo. In 1963, Parsons formed a folk group called the Shilos who performed throughout Florida and cut several demos. He graduated from high school two years later; on the same day he graduated, however, his mother died of alcohol poisoning.\n\nFollowing his graduation, Gram Parsons enrolled at Harvard to study theology. He only spent one semester at Harvard, during which time he devoted more energy to playing music than attending classes. Meanwhile, he also formed the International Submarine Band with guitarist John Nuese, bassist Ian Dunlop and drummer Mickey Gauvin. After he dropped out of college, Parsons moved to New York City with the International Submarine Band in 1966. The group spent a year in New York, developing a heavily country-influenced rock & roll sound and cutting two unsuccessful singles for Columbia Records. The band then relocated to Los Angeles in 1967, where they secured a record contract with Lee Hazlewood's LHI record label. Their debut album, Safe at Home, was released in early 1968, but by the time it appeared in stores, the International Submarine Band had already disbanded.\n\nAround the time the International Submarine Band dissolved, Parsons met Chris Hillman, the bassist for the Byrds. At that time, the Byrds were rebuilding their lineup and Hillman recommended to the band's leader, Roger McGuinn, that Parsons join the ranks. By the spring of 1968, Parsons had become a member of the Byrds and was largely responsible for the group's shift towards country music with the album Sweetheart of the Rodeo. The album was originally planned to feature Parsons' lead vocals, but as he was still contractually obligated to LHI, his voice had to be stripped from the final product.\nThe Gilded Palace of Sin\nGram Parsons only spent a few months with the Byrds, leaving the band in the fall of 1968 because he refused to accompany them on a tour of South Africa, allegedly because he opposed apartheid. Chris Hillman left the band shortly after him, and the duo formed the Flying Burrito Brothers in late 1968. Parsons and Hillman enlisted pedal steel guitarist \"Sneaky\" Pete Kleinow and bassist Chris Ethridge to complete the band's lineup, and the group and recorded a debut album with a series of session drummers. The Gilded Palace of Sin, the Flying Burrito Brothers' debut album, was released in 1969. Although the album only sold a few thousand copies, the group gathered a dedicated cult following that was mainly composed of musicians, including the Rolling Stones. In fact, by the time the album was released, Parsons had begun hanging around the Rolling Stones frequently, becoming close friends with Keith Richards. Parsons had experimented with drugs and alcohol before he met Richards, but in 1969 he dove deep into substance abuse, which he supported with his sizable trust fund.\n\nParsons recorded a second album with the Flying Burrito Brothers, but by the time the record -- titled Burrito Deluxe -- appeared in the spring of 1970, he had already left the band. Shortly after his departure, he recorded a handful of songs with producer Terry Melcher but failed to complete the album. Following those sessions, Parsons entered a holding pattern in which he acted the role of a rock star instead of actually playing music. He spent much of his time either hanging out with the Stones or ingesting large amounts of drugs and alcohol; frequently, he did a combination of the two. In 1971, Parsons toured with the Rolling Stones in England and attended the recording of the band's Exile on Main Street, and it appeared that he would sign with the band's record label. Instead, he headed back to Los Angeles late in 1971, spending the rest of the year and the first half of 1972 writing material for an impending solo album. He met Emmylou Harris through Chris Hillman, and Parsons asked her to join his backing band; she accepted.\n\nBy the summer of 1972, he was prepared to enter the studio to record his first solo album. Parsons had assembled a band -- which included Harris, guitarist James Burton, bassist Rick Grech, Barry Tashian, Glen D. Hardin, and Ronnie Tutt -- and had asked Merle Haggard to produce the album. After meeting Parsons, however, Haggard turned the offer down, and Parsons chose Haggard's engineer, Hugh Davis, as the album's producer instead. The resulting album, G.P., was released late in 1972 to good reviews but poor sales.\nGrievous Angel\nFollowing the release of G.P., Parsons embarked on a small tour with his backing band, the Fallen Angels. After the tour was completed, they entered the studio to record his second album, Grievous Angel. The album was finished toward the end of the summer, and Parsons celebrated its completion by taking a vacation near the Joshua Tree National Monument in California. He spent most of his time there consuming drugs and alcohol. On September 19, 1973, he overdosed on morphine and tequila; although rushed to the Yucca Valley Hospital, he was pronounced dead on arrival. According to the funeral plans, his body was to be flown back to New Orleans for a burial. However, Parsons' road manager stole the body after the funeral and carried it back out to the Joshua Tree desert, where he cremated the body using gasoline. Phil Kaufman later revealed that the cremation had been Parsons' wish, and although he could not be convicted for stealing the body, he was arrested for stealing and burning the coffin.\nIn the two decades following Gram Parsons' death, his legacy continued to grow, as both country and rock musicians built on the music he left behind. Musicians such as Emmylou Harris and Elvis Costello covered his songs, and his influence could still be heard well into the next millennium.",

The band was known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, country, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, and for live performances of long musical improvisation. \"Their music,\" writes Lenny Kaye, \"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world.\" They were ranked 57th in the issue The Greatest Artists of all Time by Rolling Stone magazine. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.\nThe fans of the Grateful Dead, some of whom followed the band from concert to concert for years, are known as \"Deadheads\" and are known for their dedication to the band's music. From 2003 to 2009 former members of the Grateful Dead, along with other musicians, toured as The Dead and The Other Ones.

Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac, Nimrod, and Warning did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status.

The band will begin to release a trilogy of albums over the course of five months starting in September 2012.

The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan, keyboardist Dizzy Reed, guitarist Richard Fortus, drummer Frank Ferrer and keyboardist Chris Pitman. The band has released six studio albums, accumulating sales of more than 100 million records worldwide, including shipments of 45 million in the United States, making Guns N' Roses one of the world's best-selling bands of all time.\nGuns N' Roses' debut album, Appetite for Destruction (1987), reached number one on the Billboard 200 a year after its release, on the strength of \"Sweet Child o' Mine\", the group's only single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The album has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the US, as well as the eleventh best-selling album in the United States. The success of the debut was followed by the eight-song album G N' R Lies (1988) which reached number two on the Billboard 200. The twin albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (1991) debuted at number two and number one on the Billboard 200 and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide, including 14 million units in the United States. The cover album \"The Spaghetti Incident?\" (1993) was the band's last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan. After more than a decade of work and several lineup changes, Guns N' Roses released the long-awaited album Chinese Democracy (2008) which, at an estimated $14 million in production costs, is the most expensive rock album to ever be produced in music history. It debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 but undersold industry expectations, despite mostly positive critical reception. Classic era members Slash and McKagan both rejoined the band in 2016.\nGuns N' Roses has been credited with reviving the mainstream popularity of rock music, at a time when popular music was dominated by dance music and glam metal. Its late 1980s and early 1990s years have been described as the period in which they brought forth a \"hedonistic rebelliousness\" reminiscent of the early Rolling Stones, a reputation that had earned them the nickname \"the most dangerous band in the world\".

        "strBiographyEN" : "A rapper from the United States and member of alternative hip-hop duo Gang Starr (July 17, 1961 – April 19, 2010) was one half of the legendary hip hop duo Gang Starr and an accomplished solo artist. Guru, an acronym for Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal, originally began his hip hop career in Boston but due to lack of local support moved to New York where Gang Starr then blew up. Guru was well known for his smooth voice; socially conscious and hardcore lyrics; and an effortless, confident delivery.\n\nFounded in 1987, Gang Starr built a sizable following in the early 90’s, releasing classic albums like Step In The Arena (1991) and Daily Operation (1992). Guru’s lyrical style was based on battle rhymes delivered smoothly, modestly, and with sly wit; he typically avoided using overwhelming charisma, focusing instead on his rhyming ability. Over the years he even took on younger rappers, including Jeru The Damaja, as proteges. He is credited, along with DJ Premier, for the executive production of Jeru’s debut, The Sun Rises In The East (1994).\n\nIn 1993, he released his first solo album, Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1. The album featured collaborations with Donald Byrd, N’Dea Davenport, Dee C. Lee, and Roy Ayers, whilst his second LP, Jazzmatazz, Vol. 2: The New Reality, featured Ramsey Lewis, Branford Marsalis, and Jamiroquai. The Jazzmatazz albums have been met with mixed reviews, Guru continued with Jazzmatazz, Vol. 3: Streetsoul (2000) and Baldhead Slick & da Click (2001).\n\nMoreover, recent Gang Starr albums have continued to garner Guru critical acclaim. Prominent Boston underground rapper Mr. Lif frequently cites Guru as a major stylistic influence; he appears as a guest with Lif on the Perceptionists’ debut album, Black Dialogue (2005).\n\nBesides Gang Starr, his Jazzmatazz and solo albums, Guru collaborated with countless artists since the early 90s. Not only in hip-hop, but also with artists from various genres such as pop, electronica/dance, acid jazz, and even brass bands.\n\nHis “first proper solo album”, in his own words, was Version 7.0: The Street Scriptures (2005), released with the help of producer and new backup MC/producer Solar. The album reached #1 on the college hip-hop charts, but was a failure with both fans and critics. It still managed to sell relatively well for an independent release.\n\nGuru’s latest project is the fourth installment in the Jazzmatazz series, entirely produced by Solar. It was released in early June 2007 and received good reviews and comments from fans.\n\nIn 2007 Guru was ranked at 45 for the Top 50 MCs of our time: 1987-2007\n\nOn February 28th 2010, Guru suffered a severe heart attack and was in a coma. He passed away on April 19, 2010 at the age of 49 after a long battle with cancer.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Guy was a popular 1980s and 1990s hip-hop, funk, R&B and soul band that was one of the early pioneers of hip-hop/R&B music and which set a trend in the early 1990s in a movement called the New jack swing.\n\nFormed in Harlem, New York in 1987 by young musician/record producer Teddy Riley, the original members of Guy included Riley and R&B singer-songwriters Aaron Hall and Timmy Gatling, who were students at HBCU Virginia State 1988. Gatling left after the first album was done and was quickly replaced by Aaron’s younger brother Damian. Upon its release, the album went platinum three times over and included classics like “Groove Me”, “Teddy’s Jam,” “I Like”, “Piece of My Love” and “Merry-Go-Round of Love”. That first album quickly established the group and Riley as musical forces.\n\nAfter producing music for other artists other than his group, Riley returned to the group after they opened for New Edition and released their second album, The Future, in 1990. The songs “I Wanna Get Wit U” and “Let’s Chill” gave them a broader, mainstream fan base. However, as soon as The Future’s success had dried up, Guy would be album-less for much of the 1990s. In the meantime, Riley went on to produce for artists such as Heavy D and Michael Jackson, and formed another R&B group named Blackstreet. Both Aaron and his brother Damian recorded solo albums, Aaron being a major influence on the style of R’n’b singer R. Kelly.\n\nIn 2000, Riley and the Hall brothers reunited to release their first album in nine years titled Guy III. The album featured the modest hit “Dancin’”, but their label MCA Records had a hard time promoting it. As quickly as it was released, it quickly dropped from the public radar. Since then, Guy has been relatively quiet, but rumors of working on a new album still linger.\n\nIn 2006 They were part of New Jack Reunion Tour line up, along with Blackstreet and New Edition.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "One of the big surprises of 1993 was this vocal group, who emerged from the stable of 2 Live Crew creator Luther Campbell. H-Town's single \"Knockin' Da Boots\" established the group as part of the new breed of Urban Contemporary vocal groups hearkening back to vintage soul rather than New Jack swing as their inspiration.  H-Town is an American R&B hip hop band that was formed in 1992 by three friends at Jack Yates High School in Houston, Texas. The group originally consisted of: Kevin \"Dino\" Conner, his fraternal twin brother Solomon \"Shazam\" Conner, and their long-time friend Darryl \"G.I.\" Jackson. They took the name of the group, \"H-Town,\" from the local nickname for the City of Houston.  It took H-Town six years before their first big break came. Dino and Shazam grew up surrounded by musicians and singers. All three band members went to pageants, talent shows and plays before they worked with a local producer. When they began to work with him, he sent their tape to Luther Campbell, who wasn't overly impressed.  The producer intentionally made Campbell miss a flight and dragged him back to the studio where he heard H-Town sing live. Campbell signed the group, joined up with producer Bishop \"Stick\" Burrell, and they went into the studio to start work on their debut album, Fever for Da Flavor.  On January 28, 2003, 28-year-old Dino Conner and his girlfriend Teshya Rae Weisent had just left a recording studio when their vehicle was struck by a SUV that ran a red light. Both Dino and Teshya Weisent were killed.  Three people witnessed the tragedy, but all fled the scene. One man, Juan Diaz, was later apprehended.  At the time, H-Town was working on what would become their fourth album.  H-Town finally released their reunion album, Imitations of Life, on October 12, 2004. The Remaining members of the group are in the works of making a H-Town Comeback album very soon, it is confirmed on their MySpace page.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Hall & Oates are an American musical duo composed of Daryl Hall and John Oates. They achieved their greatest fame in the late 1970s and early to mid-1980s with a fusion of rock and roll and rhythm and blues styles that they dubbed “rock and soul”. They are best known for their six #1 hits on the US Billboard Hot 100: “Rich Girl”, “Kiss on My List”, “Private Eyes”, “I Can’t Go for That (No Can Do)”, “Maneater”, and “Out of Touch”, as well as many other songs which charted in the Top 40. In total, the duo had 34 singles chart hits on the US Billboard Hot 100, seven RIAA platinum albums, and six RIAA gold albums. Because of that chart success, Billboard Magazine named them the most successful duo of the rock era, surpassing the Everly Brothers. In 2003, they were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. They were placed #15 on the Billboard Magazine list of the 100 greatest artists of all time and the #1 duo, while VH1 placed the duo as #99 on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.\n\nFrom their first hit in 1974 through their heyday in the ’80s, Daryl Hall and John Oates’ smooth, catchy take on philly soul brought them commercial success — including six number one singles and six platinum albums. Hall & Oates’ music was well-constructed and produced; at their best, their songs were filled with strong hooks and melodies that adhered to soul traditions without being a slave to them by incorporating elements of new wave and hard rock.\n\nDaryl Hall began performing professionally while he was a student at Temple University. In 1966, he recorded a single with Kenny Gamble and the Romeos; the group featured Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, and Thom Bell, who would all become the architects of Philly soul. During this time, Hall frequently appeared on sessions for Gamble and Huff. In 1967, Hall met John Oates, a fellow Temple University student. Oates was leading his own soul band at the time. The two students realized they had similar tastes and began performing together in an array of R&B and doo wop groups. By 1968, the duo had parted ways, as Oates transferred schools and Hall formed the soft rock band Gulliver; the group released one album on Elektra in the late ’60s before disbanding.\n\nAfter Gulliver’s breakup, Hall concentrated on session work again, appearing as a backup vocalist for The Stylistics, The Delfonics, and The Intruders, among others. Oates returned to Philadelphia in 1969, and he and Hall began writing folk-oriented songs and performing together. Eventually they came to the attention of Tommy Mottola, who quickly became their manager, securing the duo a contract with Atlantic Records. On their first records — Whole Oates (1972), Abandoned Luncheonette (1973), War Babies (1974) — the duo were establishing their sound, working with producers like Arif Mardin and Todd Rundgren and removing much of their folk influences. At the beginning of 1974, the duo relocated from Philadelphia to New York. During this period, they only managed one hit — the number 60 “She’s Gone” in the spring of 1974.\n\nAfter they moved to RCA in 1975, the duo landed on its successful mixture of soul, pop, and rock, scoring a Top Ten single with “Sara Smile.” The success of “Sara Smile” prompted the re-release of “She’s Gone,” which rocketed into the Top Ten as well. Released in the summer of 1976, Bigger than the Both of Us was only moderately successful upon its release. The record took off in early 1977, when “Rich Girl” became the duo’s first number one single.\n\nAlthough they had several minor hits between 1977 and 1980, the albums Hall & Oates released at the end of the decade were not as successful as their mid-’70s records. Nevertheless, they were more adventurous, incorporating more rock elements into their blue-eyed soul. The combination would finally pay off in late 1980, when the duo released the self-produced Voices, the album that marked the beginning of Hall & Oates’ greatest commercial and artistic success. The first single from Voices, a cover of Righteous Brothers’ “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling,” reached number 12, yet it was the second single, “Kiss on My List” that confirmed their commercial potential by becoming the duo’s second number one single; its follow-up, “You Make My Dreams” hit number five. They quickly released Private Eyes in the summer of 1981; the record featured two number one hits, “Private Eyes” and “I Can’t Go for That (No Can Do),” as well as the Top Ten hit “Did It in a Minute.” “I Can’t Go for That (No Can Do)” also spent a week at the top of the R&B charts — a rare accomplishment for a white act. H20 followed in 1982 and it proved more successful than their two previous albums, selling over two million copies and launching their biggest hit single, “Maneater,” as well as the Top Ten hits “One on One” and “Family Man.” The following year, the duo released a greatest-hits compilation, Rock ‘N Soul, Pt. 1, that featured two new Top Ten hits — the number two “Say It Isn’t So” and “Adult Education.”\n\nIn April of 1984, the Recording Industry Association of America announced that Hall & Oates had surpassed Everly Brothers as the most successful duo in rock history, earning a total of 19 gold and platinum awards. Released in October of 1984, Big Bam Boom expanded their number of gold and platinum awards, selling over two million copies and launching four Top 40 singles, including the number one “Out of Touch.” Following their contract-fulfilling gold album Live at the Apollo with David Ruffin & Eddie Kendrick, Hall & Oates went on hiatus. After the lukewarm reception for Daryl Hall’s 1986 solo album, Three Hearts in the Happy Ending Machine, the duo regrouped to release 1988’s Ooh Yeah!, their first record for Arista. The first single, “Everything Your Heart Desires,” went to number three and helped propel the album to platinum status.\n\nHowever, none of the album’s other singles broke the Top 20, indicating that the era of chart dominance had ended. Change of Season, released in 1990, confirmed that fact. Although the record went gold, it only featured one Top 40 hit — the number 11 single, “So Close.” The duo mounted a comeback in 1997 with Marigold Sky, but it was only partially successful; far better was 2003’s Do It for Love and the following year soul covers record Our Kind of Soul.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Hank Williams, born Hiram King Williams, was an American singer-songwriter and musician regarded as one of the most important country music artists of all time. Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that would place in the Top 10 of the Billboard Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one.\n\nBorn in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams moved to Georgiana, where he met Rufus Payne, a black street performer who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams's later musical style. During this time, Williams informally changed his name to Hank, believing it to be a better name for country music. After moving to Montgomery, Williams began his career in 1937 when WSFA radio station producers hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed as backup the Drifting Cowboys band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote all of his time to his career.\n\nWhen several of his band members were conscripted to military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements and started drinking heavily, causing WSFA to dismiss him. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who became his manager for nearly a decade. After recording \"Never Again\" and \"Honky Tonkin'\" with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1948 he released \"Move it on Over,\" which became a hit, and also joined the Louisiana Hayride radio program. In 1949, he released a cover of \"Lovesick Blues,\" which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He had 11 number one songs between 1948 and 1953, though he was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were \"Your Cheatin' Heart,\" \"Hey, Good Lookin',\" and \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.\"\n\nDuring his last years Williams's consumption of alcohol, morphine and other painkillers severely compromised his professional and personal life. He divorced his wife and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry due to frequent drunkenness. Williams died suddenly in the early morning hours of New Years Day in 1953 at the age of 29 from heart failure brought on by pills and alcohol. Despite his short life, Williams has had a major influence on country music. The songs he wrote and recorded have been covered by numerous artists, many of whom have also had hits with the tunes, in a range of pop, gospel, blues and rock styles.",

With the addition of Pendergrass, and the ornate, orchestral productions that Gamble & Huff supplied them with, the group found success with such tracks as “I Miss You”, “If You Don’t Know Me By Now”, and “The Love I Lost”. Together with The Spinners, The O’Jays and The Delfonics, among others, they helped to define the philly sound. In 1976, Pendergrass left for a solo career, and the Blue Notes were not able to sustain their success for long without him, though they continued to record until 1984.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson were the creative spark behind Heart, a hard-rock group who initially found success in the mid-'70s, only to reach greater heights after engineering a major comeback a decade later. The daughters of a Marine Corps captain, Ann (born June 19, 1950) and Nancy (born March 16, 1954) grew up in both Southern California and Taiwan before the Wilson family settled in Seattle, Washington. Throughout their formative years, both were interested in folk and pop music; while Ann never took any formal music lessons as a child (she later learned to play several instruments), Nancy took up guitar and flute. After both sisters spent some time at college, they decided to try their hand as professional musicians, and while Nancy began performing as a folksinger, Ann joined the all-male vocal group Heart.\n\nBased in Vancouver, British Columbia, Heart was actually formed in 1963 by bassist Steve Fossen, and friends Roger Fisher and Mike Flicker; initially dubbed the Army, they later became White Heart before settling on simply Heart at the beginning of the 1970s. After her arrival in the group, Ann became romantically involved with guitarist Mike Flicker; when Nancy joined in 1974, she in turn began a relationship with guitarist Roger. Soon after Nancy's arrival, Mike Fisher retired from active performing to become the band's sound engineer. After gaining a following in Vancouver, Heart was approached by Shelly Siegel, the owner of the Canadian label Mushroom; augmented by keyboadist Howard Leese and drummer Michael Derosier, they recorded their debut album, Dreamboat Annie, in 1975.\n\nAfter selling more than 30, 000 copies north of the border, Mushroom issued the LP in the U.S., where it quickly achieved platinum status on the strength of the hit singles \"Crazy on You\" and \"Magic Man.\" In 1977, Heart jumped ship to the CBS affiliate Portrait, resulting in a protracted legal battle with Siegel, who in 1978 released the unfinished LP Magazine on Mushroom shortly after the band issued its true follow-up Little Queen on Portrait. The single \"Barracuda\" was another massive hit, and like its predecessor, Little Queen sold over a million copies.\n\nAfter 1978's Dog and Butterfly, both of the Wilson/Fisher romances ended, and Roger left the group. In 1980, Heart issued Bebe Le Strange; following a lengthy U.S. tour, both Fossen and Derosier exited, and were replaced by ex-Spirit and Firefall bassist Mark Andes and former Gamma drummer Denny Carmassi. After 1982's Private Audition and 1983's Passionwerks slumped, the group was largely written off by industry watchers, and moved to Capitol Records.\n\nIn 1985, however, Heart emerged with a self-titled effort which ultimately sold more than five million copies on its way to launching four Top Ten hits -- \"What About Love?,\" \"Never,\" the chart-topping \"These Dreams\" and \"Nothin' at All.\" 1987's Bad Animals continued their comeback success; \"Alone\" was another Number One hit, and both \"Who Will You Run To\" and \"There's the Girl\" achieved considerable airplay as well. Brigade, issued in 1990, featured the Number Two smash \"All I Want to Do Is Make Love to You,\" as well as the Top 25 hits \"I Didn't Want to Need You\" and \"Stranded.\"\n\nIn the early '90s, the Wilson sisters took a brief hiatus from Heart to form the Lovemongers, an acoustic quartet fleshed out by Sue Ennis and Frank Cox; in 1992, they issued a four-song EP which included a cover of Led Zeppelin's \"The Battle of Evermore.\" Heart returned in 1993 with Desire Walks On, on which Andes and Carmassi were replaced with bassist Fernando Saunders and drummer Denny Fongheiser. With 1995's The Road Home, Heart enlisted onetime Led Zep bassist John Paul Jones to produce a live, acoustic set reprising hits like \"Dreamboat Annie,\" \"Crazy on You\" and \"Barracuda.\"",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Helloween is a German power metal band founded in 1984. The band was a pioneering force in the power metal subgenres and their second and third studio albums, Keeper of the Seven Keys, Pt. 1 and Pt. 2, are considered masterpieces of the genre. Twelve musicians have been a part of the band's line-up in its history, which has consisted of singer Andi Deris, guitarists Michael Weikath and Sascha Gerstner, bass guitarist Markus Grosskopf, and drummer Daniel Löble since 2005.\n\nHelloween was formed in 1984 by members of bands Iron Fist, Gentry, and Powerfool. Its first line-up consisted of Weikath, Grosskopf, singer and guitarist Kai Hansen and drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg. After the release of a self-titled EP and a first album in 1985, it expanded into a quintet when singer Michael Kiske joined, with Hansen only acting as guitarist. Under this line-up, they released the Keeper of the Seven Keys albums (1987 and 1988), which established Helloween as a notable heavy metal band and led to the creation of the power metal subgenre. However, Hansen left the band quickly after the release of Pt. 2 and was replaced by Roland Grapow. He then created the band Gamma Ray.\n\nHelloween's first two albums without Hansen, Pink Bubbles Go Ape (1991) and Chameleon (1993), were commercial and critical failures, which created tensions between band members and led to the firing of Schwichtenberg and the departure of Kiske. They were replaced by Uli Kusch and Deris respectively. The albums released under this line-up (the longest in the band's history), consisting of Master of the Rings (1994), The Time of the Oath (1996), Better Than Raw (1998) and The Dark Ride (2000), received a warm reception from both fans and critics, gradually establishing Helloween as a successful band again.\n\nHowever, tensions following the release of The Dark Ride led to the dismissals of both Grapow and Kusch, who then went on to found Masterplan together. Grapow was replaced by Gerstner, but the attempts to find a new drummer were chaotic and no band member was credited for drums on the album Rabbit Don't Come Easy (2003). The band finally found a stable drummer in the person of Löble in 2005. Under this new and current line-up, the second longest in its history, the band has released three successful studio albums: Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy (2005), Gambling with the Devil (2007), and 7 Sinners (2010), with all members except Löble contributing to the songwriting. A new album, Straight Out of Hell, was released in january of 2013.\n\nSince its creation, Helloween has released thirteen studio albums, three live albums, three EPs, and twenty-six singles, and has sold more than five million copies worldwide.",

The group, which was formed in 1990, consisted of Tony Thompson, Roderick “Pooh” Clark, Marcus Sanders, Russell Neal, and Toriano Easley. Easley was later replaced by Treston Irby.\n\nHi-Five was signed to Jive Records and released their first album, Hi-Five, in 1990. The album went multi-platinum and was produced by award-winning hitmaker Teddy Riley; it included such singles as “I Just Can’t Handle It”, “I Can’t Wait Another Minute”, and their biggest hit to date, “I Like The Way (The Kissing Game)”, which went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard R&B chart. The group enjoyed mainstream success and received comparisons to many of their R&B counterparts, namely New Edition.\n\nHi-Five’s second LP, Keep It Goin’ On, came out in 1992. Though not as successful as their debut effort, several tracks from this album, including “She’s Playing Hard To Get” and the R. Kelly-penned “Quality Time” got major airplay. Shortly after this album was released, Roderick “Pooh” Clark was involved in a near-fatal automobile accident. In 1993, Hi-Five emerged with a third album, Faithful, which featured the songs “Unconditional Love” and “Never Should Have Let You Go”.\n\nAfter Hi-Five disbanded around 1994, Thompson released a solo album, Sexsational. He scored a minor hit with “I Wanna Love Like That”.\n\nIn 2005, Thompson re-incarnated Hi-Five with four new members, one of whom is his younger brother, Jordan. Their new album The Return was released in 2006 on Thompson’s independent label, N’Depth.\n\nUnfortunately, on June 1st, 2007, the lead singer Tony Thompson passed away in his hometown of Waco, TX. During this time, Tony Thompson was working on a reunion.\n\nTony’s vision is now coming to fruition with the leadership of long-time friend and band mate, “Trus” (Treston Irby) who has retooled Hi-Five to preserve the signature 90’s sound and create new music for listeners born in the 90’s. They are now in the studio and preparing to drop a new album on Irby’s Bronx Most Wanted label.",

The band is fronted by singer-songwriter Courtney Love (vocals, rhythm guitar), who co-founded Hole with Eric Erlandson (lead guitar). Hole achieved considerable commercial and critical success throughout the 1990s, initially releasing singles through independent labels in L.A. and debuting with their caustic noise rock-influenced Pretty on the Inside (1991), and later gaining near-unanimous critical acclaim with their 1994 album Live Through This.\nAs the band progressed into the later 1990s, they incorporated elements of power pop into their sound. The band's third album, Celebrity Skin (1998), fused hard rock with various pop elements, contrasting to their previous styles. Celebrity Skin went on to be the band's most commercially successful album, garnering them immense critical attention as well as several Grammy nominations.\nThe group officially disbanded in 2002 and its members began solo careers and other projects. In 2009, Love announced she was reforming Hole as the sole returning member. Erlandson, however, stated that no reunion could take place contractually without mutual involvement between Love and Erlandson. On January 1, 2010, a website promoting Hole's latest release, Nobody's Daughter, was launched, with links to various social media pages including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and MySpace.\nDespite the dispute between Erlandson and Love, the new Hole album was released in April 2010 and the band toured Europe and North America in support of the record.",

Mainstays are Garry Gary Beers on bass guitar, Andrew Farriss on guitar and keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on lead guitar and Kirk Pengilly on guitar and saxophone. For 20 years, INXS were fronted by Michael Hutchence on lead vocals, whose \"sultry good looks\" and magnetic stage presence made him the focal point of the band. Initially known for their New Wave/ska/pop style, they later developed a harder pub rock style, including funk and dance elements.\nIn the early 1980s, INXS first charted in their native Australia with their debut self-titled album, but later garnered moderate success elsewhere with Shabooh Shoobah and a single, \"The One Thing\". Though The Swing brought more success from around the world, its single \"Original Sin\" was even greater commercially, becoming their first number-one single. They would later achieve international success with a series of hit recordings through later in the 1980s and the 1990s, including the albums Listen Like Thieves, Kick, and X; and the singles \"What You Need\", \"Need You Tonight\", \"Devil Inside\", \"New Sensation\", and \"Suicide Blonde\".\nIn the 1990s, INXS brought a new audience following Hutchence's romance with pop singer Kylie Minogue, and achieved greater acclaim in the UK. However, starting with Welcome to Wherever You Are, in 1992, they achieved less success in the United States. A depressed Hutchence committed suicide by hanging in 1997 and INXS did not perform publicly for a year. They made appearances with several guest singers including Jimmy Barnes, Terence Trent D'Arby, and Jon Stevens; Stevens formally joined the band for a tour and recording session in 2002. In 2005, members of INXS participated in a reality television series, broadcast worldwide, culminating in the selection of their new lead singer, Canadian J.D. Fortune, and the release of \"Pretty Vegas\" and \"Afterglow\" as singles, and its album Switch. In late 2010, they recorded and released Original Sin, a tribute album, featuring guest artists such as Kavyen Temperley (of Eskimo Joe) and Ben Harper. In September 2011 the band announced that Northern Irish singer-songwriter Ciaran Gribbin had replaced Fortune as their lead vocalist ahead of a planned tour of South America, Australia & Europe later in the year.\nINXS has won six Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) awards including three for 'Best Group' in 1987, 1989 and 1992, and was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001. To date INXS have sold more than 30 million records.",

Though considered an innovator of punk rock, Pop's music has encompassed a number of styles over the years, including pop, metal, jazz and blues. Pop became known as 'Iggy' in high school, during which time he served as drummer for local blues band The Iguanas. He is vocalist of influential protopunk band The Stooges (Pop and the other surviving members of the group reunited in 2003), having become known, since the late 1960s, for his outrageous and unpredictable stage antics.\nThough the singer's popularity has waned and waxed throughout his career, Pop has recorded a number of well-known songs, including \"Lust for Life\", \"Real Wild Child\", \"I Wanna Be Your Dog,\" \"Candy\" (a duet with Kate Pierson of The B-52's), \"China Girl\", \"Nightclubbing\", \"Search and Destroy\", and \"The Passenger\".\nThe Stooges were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.\nIggy Pop (AKA Iggy Stooge) was born in Muskegon, Michigan, the son of Louella (née Christensen) and James Newell Osterberg, Sr., a former high school English teacher and baseball coach at Fordson High School in Dearborn, Michigan. Osterberg was raised in a trailer park in Ypsilanti, Michigan. He is of Irish and English descent on his father's side, and of Norwegian and Danish ancestry on his mother's. His father was adopted by a Swedish American family and took on their surname (Österberg).\nOsterberg began his music career as a drummer in different high school bands in Ann Arbor, Michigan. One band was the Iguanas, from the name of which he adopted his future moniker Iggy. After exploring local blues-style bands such as the Prime Movers (with brothers Dan and Michael Erlewine), he eventually dropped out of the University of Michigan and moved to Chicago to learn more about blues. While in Chicago, he played drums in blues clubs, helped by Sam Lay (formerly of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band) who shared his connections with Iggy. Inspired by Chicago blues as well as bands like The Sonics and The MC5, he formed the Psychedelic Stooges and began calling himself Iggy. The band was composed of Iggy on vocals, Ron Asheton on guitar, Asheton's brother Scott on drums, and Dave Alexander on bass.",

This song title to the single from their 2012 debut KidInaKorner/Interscope release “Continued Silence EP” is an all too apt descriptor of the band’s hard-earned success—but it’s also emblematic of the deep-seated anxiety Reynolds and the rest of the band experienced leaving behind any realistic expectation of a normal job to do the thing they love most.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Jackson 5 (also spelled The Jackson Five, sometimes stylized The Jackson 5ive), later known as The Jacksons, or simply Jacksons, are an American popular music family group from Gary, Indiana. Founding group members Jackie Jackson, Tito Jackson, Jermaine Jackson, Marlon Jackson and Michael Jackson formed the group after performing in an early incarnation called The Jackson Brothers, which originally consisted of a trio of the three older brothers. Active from 1964 to 1990, the Jacksons played from a repertoire of R&B, soul, pop and (in the 1970s) disco. During their six-and-a-half-year Motown tenure, The Jackson 5 was one of the biggest pop-music acts of the 1970s, and the band served as the launching pad for the solo careers of their lead singers Jermaine and Michael, the latter brother later transforming his early Motown solo fame into greater success as an adult artist. The Jackson 5/The Jacksons have sold 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best selling artists of all time.\nThe Jackson 5 was one of very few in recording history to have their first four major label singles (\"I Want You Back\", \"ABC\", \"The Love You Save\", and \"I'll Be There\") reach the top of the Billboard Hot 100. Several later singles, among them \"Mama's Pearl\", \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" and \"Dancing Machine\", were Top 5 pop hits and number-one hits on the R&B singles chart. Most of the early hits were written and produced by a specialized songwriting team known as \"The Corporation\"; later Jackson 5 hits were crafted chiefly by Hal Davis, while early Jacksons hits were compiled by the team of Gamble and Huff before The Jacksons began writing and producing themselves in the late 1970s.\nSignificantly, they were one of the first black teen idols to appeal equally to white audiences, thanks partially to the successful promotional relations skills of Motown Records CEO Berry Gordy. With their departure from Motown to CBS in 1976, The Jacksons were forced to change their name and Jermaine was replaced with younger brother Randy as Jermaine chose to stay at Motown. During these years, they continued to have a number of hits such as \"Enjoy Yourself\", \"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)\", \"Show You the Way to Go\", and \"Blame It on the Boogie\". After two years under the Philadelphia International Records label, they signed with Epic Records and asserted control of their songwriting, production, and image, and their success continued into the 1980s with hits such as \"Can You Feel It\", \"This Place Hotel\", \"Lovely One\", and \"State of Shock\". Their 1989 album 2300 Jackson Street was recorded without Michael and Marlon, although they did appear on the title track. The disappointing sales of the album led to the group being dropped by their record label at the end of the year. The group has never formally broken up, but has been dormant since then, although all six brothers performed together at two Michael Jackson tribute concerts in September 2001. After Michael's death in June 2009, the group announced a 2012 reunion tour, The Unity Tour, although Randy did not take part.",

He is the originator of funk music and is a major figure of 20th century popular music and dance.\nIn a career that spanned six decades, Brown profoundly influenced the development of many different musical genres. Brown moved on a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly \"Africanized\" approach to music making. Brown performed in concerts, first making his rounds across the Chitlin' Circuit, and then across the country and later around the world, along with appearing in shows on television and in movies. Although he contributed much to the music world through his hitmaking, Brown holds the record as the artist who charted the most singles on the Billboard Hot 100 without ever hitting number one on that chart.\nFor many years, Brown's touring show was one of the most extravagant productions in American popular music. At the time of Brown's death, his band included three guitarists, two bass guitar players, two drummers, three horns and a percussionist. The bands that he maintained during the late 1960s and 1970s were of comparable size, and the bands also included a three-piece amplified string section that played during ballads. Brown employed between 40 and 50 people for the James Brown Revue, and members of the revue traveled with him in a bus to cities and towns all over the country, performing upwards of 330 shows a year with almost all of the shows as one-nighters. In 1986, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 1990 into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\nBrown died on Christmas Day, December 25, in 2006 from heart failure after becoming ill on December 23 and being hospitalized for hours. James Brown is buried in Beech Island, South Carolina.",

Fronted by lead singer Jay Kay, Jamiroquai were initially the most prominent component in the early-1990s London-based acid jazz movement, alongside groups such as Incognito, the James Taylor Quartet, and the Brand New Heavies. Other Acid Jazz artists such as 'Moses Mayes' and Groove Collective are popular comparisons. Subsequent albums have explored other musical directions such as pop, rock and electronica. Their best known track is \"Virtual Insanity\", which won four awards at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards. Jamiroquai have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide and won a Grammy Award in 1998.\nThe band name is a portmanteau of \"jam session\" and \"iroquai\", based on the Iroquois, a Native American tribe. The original band was Jay Kay (vocals), Toby Smith (keyboard), Stuart Zender (bass), Nick Van Gelder (drums) and Wallis Buchanan (didgeridoo). These are the founding members of Jamiroquai and were involved in the writing and production of the first album. The lineup of the band has changed several times, and the longest serving and now core members of the band are lead singer and songwriter Jason \"Jay\" Kay and drummer Derrick McKenzie (since 1994). Kay was the impetus behind the formation of Jamiroquai, deciding to form the band after an unsuccessful audition to become the singer of the Brand New Heavies. Despite his self-professed attempts to treat Jamiroquai as a band, Kay has always been at the forefront of the band.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969), better known by his stage name Jay-Z, is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, entrepreneur, and occasional actor. He is one of the most financially successful hip hop artists and entrepreneurs in America, having a net worth of over $450 million as of 2011. He has sold approximately 50 million albums worldwide, while receiving fourteen Grammy Awards for his musical work, and numerous additional nominations. He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest rappers of all-time. He was ranked #1 by MTV in their list of The Greatest MCs of All-Time in 2006. Two of his albums, Reasonable Doubt (1996) and The Blueprint (2001) are considered landmarks in the genre with both of them being ranked in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Blender included the former on their 500 CDs You Must Own Before You Die.\nJay-Z co-owns the 40/40 Club, is part-owner of the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and is also the creator of the line Rocawear. He is the former CEO of Def Jam Recordings, one of the three founders of Roc-A-Fella Records, and the founder of Roc Nation. As an artist, he holds the record for most number one albums by a solo artist on the Billboard 200 with eleven. Jay-Z also has had four number ones on the Billboard Hot 100, one as lead artist.\nHe married American R&B singer Beyoncé Knowles on April 4, 2008. He had a daughter named Blue Ivy Carter on January 2012. On December 11, 2009, Jay-Z was ranked as the 10th most successful artist of 2000s by Billboard and ranking as the 5th top solo male artist and as the 4th top rapper behind Eminem, Nelly, and 50 Cent. He is also ranked the 88th greatest artist of all time, according to Rolling Stone.\nOriginally from Marcy Houses, a housing project in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City, the future \"Jay-Z\" then known as Shawn Carter, was abandoned by his father and in 1982, he shot his brother in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry. Carter attended Eli Whitney High School in Brooklyn, along with future rapper AZ, until it was closed down. After that he attended George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School in Downtown Brooklyn, with fellow future rappers The Notorious B.I.G. and Busta Rhymes, and Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey, but did not graduate. In his music he refers to having been involved in selling crack cocaine.\nAccording to his mother, Gloria Carter, her son Shawn used to wake his siblings up at night banging out drum patterns on the kitchen table. Eventually, she bought him a boom box for his birthday, sparking his interest in music. He began freestyling, writing lyrics, and followed the music of many artists popular at the time. In his neighborhood, Carter was known as \"Jazzy\", a nickname that eventually developed into his showbiz/stage name, \"Jay-Z\". The moniker is also an homage to his musical mentor, Jaz-O, as well as to the J/Z subway lines that have a stop at Marcy Avenue in Brooklyn.\nJay-Z can briefly be heard on several of Jaz-O's early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \"The Originators\" and \"Hawaiian Sophie\". Jay-Z was also involved in and won several battles with rapper LL Cool J in the early 90's as part of a plan to get a sought-after record deal. He first became known to a wide audience by being featured on the posse cut \"Show and Prove\" on the 1994 Big Daddy Kane album Daddy's Home. Jay-Z has been referred to as Big Daddy Kane's hype man during this period, though Kane explains that he didn't fill the traditional hype man role, instead Jay-Z \"basically made cameo appearances on stage. When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage\". He made an appearance on a popular song by Big L, \"Da Graveyard\", and on Mic Geronimo's \"Time to Build\", which also featured early appearances by DMX, and Ja Rule in 1995. His first official rap single was called \"I Can't Get With That\", for which he released a music video.",

The band moved to Los Angeles in 1970 and changed its name to L.T.D. Osborne was originally brought on as the drummer and eventually became the lead vocalist. After more than ten years with the band, he decided to pursue a solo career, which produced such Top 40 hits as \"Don't You Get So Mad,\" \"Stay With Me Tonight,\" and \"Love Power,\" which he performed with Dionne Warwick.  Born in Providence, RI, Jeffrey Osborne was the youngest of 12 children and was constantly bombarded with music as he was growing up. He had five brothers and six sisters, some of whom went on to have music careers. His father, Clarence \"Legs\" Osborne, was a popular trumpeter who played with Lionel Hampton, Count Basie, and Duke Ellington, and died when Jeffrey was only 13. His mother, Wanita, is ancestored by a Pequot Indian sachem. His oldest brother, Clay Osborne, is a singer and pianist, and Billy, another brother, is a songwriter and producer in Los Angeles. But Osborne's father had the greatest influence on his musical career; Clarence \"Legs\" Osborne turned down many top band offers during his career to be with his family. It was only after receiving his mother's encouragement that Jeffrey left for Los Angeles to play with L.T.D. At the age of 15, he sat in with the O'Jays when the drummer was too tired to play, and went on to play with them for two weeks. It was at a Providence nightclub that fate brought him together with the band Love Men Ltd. in 1969.  Osborne's solo career has brought him five gold and platinum albums, including Stay With Me Tonight, Aymuk, and Only Human. He also recorded an album of duets with popular singer James Ingram, and scored an international hit with \"On the Wings of Love\" in 1982. Osborne's touring and recording continue to keep him busy much of the time, but he also devotes some of his time to charity work.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Born Heidi Stern, in Queens, New York, she spent her childhood in both New York and the State of Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany. It was in Flensburg, Germany, that she first discovered her passion for music. She recorded her first album Heidi Stern in 1979, but it did not get much attention. Trying to establish her career as a singer, in 1982, she moved to Wiesbaden, Hessen, Germany, with her father Maurice Stern, an opera singer. Over the next several years she scored hits around Europe with songs \"25 Lovers\", \"Flames of Paradise\", \"Ring of Ice\", \"Destiny\", \"If You're Ever Gonna Lose My Love\", \"I Come Undone\" and \"Madonna's Eyes\".\nJennifer's mother Barbara was a pianist, and her brothers are musicians Bobby Stern and Stephen Stern. In 2010, Jennifer revealed that she adopted her artist name \"Jennifer\" upon the insistence of her record company, CBS, who felt Heidi did not sound 'international' enough.\nHer single \"The Power Of Love\" was the biggest selling single of 1985 in the United Kingdom, (as well as becoming a significant hit in Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Portugal, South Africa and Sweden) and was listed in the Guinness Book Of Records as \"the best-selling single by a female solo artist in the history of the British music industry\". It held that status until 1992, when it was outsold by Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\". \"The Power of Love\" topped the charts for more than eight weeks in Australia, South Africa and numerous European countries. Number one in several countries, Rush's version reached only number 57 in the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart. After several cover versions by other artists, the Celine Dion version made a U.S. chart impact in 1994.\nRush remained successful in Europe and notably in Germany where her next two albums reached number 1 for 14 weeks and 9 weeks respectively. In the UK however, her chart career saw only a few sporadic bursts of success, but did manage three top 50 albums. Part of the reason she didn't have much more success in the UK was because of the lack of promotion she got, also she found it hard to emulate the same level of success as her first release. It was Rush's 1987 album Heart Over Mind, featuring compositions by Desmond Child and Michael Bolton and guitar work from Richie Sambora (Bon Jovi), that finally brought her Top 40 success in her home country, with the Elton John duet \"Flames of Paradise\". She also recorded duets with Michael Bolton, Plácido Domingo and Brian May.\nWhile she continued to achieve platinum and multi-platinum sales of albums and singles in both English and Spanish, recognition eluded her in her home country. Rush built on her success through the 1990s in Europe (again, especially in Germany), releasing four albums, the last being 1998's Classics (along with new songs, re-recording her biggest hits with the Hungarian Philharmonic Orchestra). After that she took some time off in New York, dedicating time to her daughter. A series of greatest hits compilation albums followed in the new millennium.\nShe released a boxed set Stronghold - The Collector's Hit Box in August 2007. This compilation included all Rush singles from 1982 to 1991 (with her first record company), and in their \"extended versions\" as available. It also included all the B-sides and other rare or unreleased tracks (among them four James Bond theme songs, recorded live in 1984 and only released in a very limited edition by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra).\nIn 2006 she moved to London with her daughter. On March 6, 2009 Rush announced on her official website that she had signed a worldwide recording contract with Sony Music / Ariola. This meant a return to the recording label where she made her international breakthrough in the 1980s and released the first five studio albums of her career. Now Is the Hour, produced by Berlin-based producer team Valicon, was released on March 5, 2010 in Germany, and on March 8, 2010 in the UK. It was her first album with completely new material in over thirteen years.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Jennifer Jean Warnes is an American singer, songwriter, arranger, and record producer. She is known for her interpretations of compositions written by herself and many others as well as an extensive playlist as a vocalist on movie soundtracks. She is a close friend of and collaborator with Canadian singer-songwriter and poet, Leonard Cohen.\nWarnes was born in Seattle, Washington, and raised in Anaheim, California. Her desire and ability to sing came early; at age seven she was offered her first recording contract, which her father turned down. She sang in church and local pageants until age 17 when Warnes was offered an opera scholarship to Immaculate Heart College. She chose to sing folk music as it became popularized by Joan Baez in the mid-1960s. In 1968, after a few years with musical theatre and clubs, she signed with Parrot Records (a London Records subsidiary) and recorded her first LP. That year, she joined the cast of the television show The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. Early in her career, industry advisors suggested she change her name to “Warren”, but then realized that there was already an actress named Jennifer Warren, so she performed for a short time under the single name “Jennifer”, but soon returned to using her birth name “Warnes\". In November 1968, Warnes (as \"Jennifer Warren\") portrayed the female lead in the Los Angeles, California production of the stage musical Hair. She had a related UK single release as \"Jennifer\" on London HLU 10278 in June 1969 with \"Let The Sunshine In\" c/w \"Easy To Be Hard\", licensed from US Parrot label.\nIn 1971, she met Canadian songwriter and poet, Leonard Cohen, and the two have remained lifelong friends. She would eventually tour Europe with Cohen's band in 1972 and 1979, first as a back-up singer and then as a vocal arranger and guest singer on Cohen's albums Live Songs (1973), Recent Songs (1979), Various Positions (1985), I'm Your Man (1988), The Future (1992), Field Commander Cohen: Tour of 1979 (2001), and Old Ideas (2012). Warnes would later (1987) record a critically acclaimed audiophile album of Cohen songs, Famous Blue Raincoat. In 1972, she released her third album, Jennifer, which was produced by John Cale and has yet to be reissued. In 1976 Warnes released the album which would contain her breakthrough single, \"Right Time of the Night\", hitting No. 1 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart in April 1977 and No. 6 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart in May 1977.\nWarnes recorded the song, \"It Goes Like It Goes\", for the 1979 motion picture, Norma Rae. The song went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Her 1979 single, \"I Know A Heartache When I See One\", was a Top 10 Country hit and reached the Top 20 on both the Pop and Adult Contemporary charts.\nWarnes recorded the Randy Newman composition \"One More Hour\" for the 1981 motion picture Ragtime. This became her second performance of a song to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.\n\nWarnes teamed up with Joe Cocker to record \"Up Where We Belong\" for the 1982 motion picture An Officer and a Gentleman. Written by Buffy Sainte-Marie, Will Jennings and Jack Nitzsche, the song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as a Golden Globe Award. The song also won Warnes and Cocker the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. The million-selling Gold-certified 45 was released as a single and hit No. 1 (for three weeks running) on Billboard's Hot 100 chart and stands as Jennifer's biggest selling disc being certified 'Platinum' for over two million sales in the United States alone. The same year, she recorded a moving performance of James Taylor's Millworker for the American Playhouse PBS production of Working.\n\nWarnes teamed up with Bill Medley to record \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\" for the 1987 motion picture Dirty Dancing. This marked the third song performed by Warnes to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song and Golden Globe Award. The song also won Warnes and Medley the Grammy Award for Duo or Group with Vocal. It reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent four consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nOn September 30, 1987, at the Coconut Grove in Los Angeles, she contributed background vocals for Roy Orbison's star-studded television special Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night.\n\nShe recorded a duet version with B. J. Thomas of the song \"As Long As We've Got Each Other\", the theme for the TV show Growing Pains. It was used as the opening theme until the fourth season, when the song was once again re-recorded with Thomas and Dusty Springfield. However, it made its return for the fifth and final seasons of the show.\n\nIn 1985, she contributed vocals for Leonard Cohen's record Various Positions, getting equal vocals credits with Cohen in the inside booklet. After releasing praised tribute LP of Leonard Cohen's songs in 1987, Famous Blue Raincoat, to which Cohen contributed two new compositions, \"First We Take Manhattan\" and \"Ain't No Cure for Love\", she vocally contributed to Cohen's 1988 hit LP I'm Your Man, most notably to \"Take This Waltz\" and Cohen's signature song \"Tower of Song\".\nIn August 2007, the Shout Factory Records label re-released the 20th anniversary edition of Famous Blue Raincoat, with a 24-page booklet and four additional songs. The Hunter was re-released in 2009, and The Well was re-released in September 2010.\n\nAll remasters were issued on high quality vinyl and 24K Gold discs. \"Famous Blue Raincoat\" was released with 4 bonus tracks. \"The Hunter\" was released without bonus material. The re-released \"The Well,\" however, contains a total of 14 tracks. These include two recordings from the original session that had never before been heard publicly: \"La Luna Brilla\", \"A Fool for the Look (in Your Eyes\", and one extra bonus selection, \"Show Me the Light\" (a second duet with Bill Medley which was originally featured on the 1998 movie soundtrack \"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer-The Movie\").\n\nWarnes has contributed to tribute recordings to Ian Tyson, Warren Zevon and Alejandro Escovedo. In 2009, she conducted a much awaited tour of the west and northwest, and was in top vocal form singing CD favorites and new material. In 2010, Warnes started work on a new solo recording of original and cover songs at Capitol Records. The title of this album had not been revealed as of June 2010, nor had a release date for it been announced by that time. In September 2011, Warnes toured Canada. In September - October 2012, she is touring selected venues in Canada and the U.S.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Is there an early rock & roller who has a crazier reputation than the Killer, Jerry Lee Lewis? His exploits as a piano-thumping, egocentric wild man with an unquenchable thirst for living have become the fodder for numerous biographies, film documentaries, and a full-length Hollywood movie. Certainly few other artists came to the party with more ego and talent than he and lived to tell the tale. And certainly even fewer could successfully channel that energy into their music and prosper doing it as well as Jerry Lee. When he broke on the national scene in 1957 with his classic \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,\" he was every parents' worst nightmare perfectly realized: a long, blonde-haired Southerner who played the piano and sang with uncontrolled fury and abandon, while simultaneously reveling in his own sexuality. He was rock & roll's first great wild man and also rock & roll's first great eclectic. Ignoring all manner of musical boundaries is something that has not only allowed his music to have wide variety, but to survive the fads and fashions as well. Whether singing a melancholy country ballad, a lowdown blues, or a blazing rocker, Lewis' wholesale commitment to the moment brings forth performances that are totally grounded in his personality and all singularly of one piece. Like the recordings of Hank Williams, Louis Armstrong, and few others, Jerry Lee's early recorded work is one of the most amazing collections of American music in existence.\nHe was born to Elmo and Mamie Lewis on September 29, 1935. Though the family was dirt poor, there was enough money to be had to purchase a third-hand upright piano for the family's country shack in Ferriday, LA. Sharing piano lessons with his two cousins, Mickey Gilley and Jimmy Lee Swaggart, a ten-year old Jerry Lee Lewis showed remarkable aptitude toward the instrument. A visit from piano-playing older cousin Carl McVoy unlocked the secrets to the boogie-woogie styles he was hearing on the radio and across the tracks at Haney's Big House, owned by his uncle, Lee Calhoun, and catering to blacks exclusively. Lewis mixed that up with gospel and country and started coming up with his own style. He even mixed genres in the way he syncopated his rhythms on the piano; his left hand generally played a rock-solid boogie pattern while his right played the high keys with much flamboyant filigree and showiness, equal parts gospel fervor and Liberace showmanship. By the time he was 14, by all family accounts, he was as good as he was ever going to get. Lewis was already ready for prime time.\nBut his mother Mamie had other plans for the young family prodigy. Not wanting to squander Jerry Lee's gifts on the sordid world of show business, she enrolled him in a bible college in Waxahatchie, TX, secure in the knowledge that her son would now be exclusively singing his songs to the Lord. But legend has it that the Killer tore into a boogie-woogie rendition of \"My God Is Real\" at a church assembly that sent him packing the same night. The split personality of Lewis, torn between the sacred and the profane (rock & roll music), is something that has eaten away at him most of his adult life, causing untold aberrant personality changes over the years with no clear-cut answers to the problem. What is certain is that by the time a 21-year-old Jerry Lee showed up in Memphis on the doorstep of the Sun studios, he had been thrown out of bible college; been a complete failure as a sewing-machine salesman; been turned down by most Nashville-based record companies and the Louisiana Hayride; been married twice; in jail once; and burned with the passion that he truly was the next big thing.\nSam Phillips was on vacation when he arrived, but his assistant Jack Clement put Roland Janes on guitar and J.M. Van Eaton on drums behind Lewis, whose fluid left hand made a bass player superfluous. This little unit would become the core of Lewis' recording band for almost the entire seven years he recorded at Sun. The first single, a hopped-up rendition of Ralph Mooney's \"Crazy Arms,\" sold in respectable enough quantities that Phillips kept bringing Lewis back in for more sessions, astounded by his prodigious memory for old songs and his penchant for rocking them up. A few days after his first single was released, Jerry Lee was in the Sun studios earning some Christmas money, playing backup piano on a Carl Perkins session that yielded the classics \"Matchbox\" and \"Your True Love.\" At the tail-end of the recording, Elvis Presley showed up, Clement turned on the tape machine, and the impromptu Million Dollar Quartet jam session ensued, with Perkins, Presley, and Lewis all having the time of their lives.\nWith the release of his first single, the road beckoned and it was here that Lewis' lasting stage persona was developed. Discouraged because he couldn't dance around the stage strumming a guitar like Carl Perkins, he stood up in mid-song, kicked back the piano stool and, as Perkins has so saliently pointed out, \"a new Jerry Lee Lewis was born.\" This newfound stage confidence was not lost on Sam Phillips. While he loved the music of Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash, he saw neither artist as a true contender to Elvis' throne; with Lewis he thought he had a real shot. For the first time in his very parsimonious life, Sam Phillips threw every dime of promotional capital he had into Lewis' next single, and the gamble paid off a million times over. \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" went to number one on the country and the R&B charts, and was only held out of the top spot on the pop charts by Debbie Reynolds' \"Tammy.\" Suddenly, Lewis was the hottest, newest, most exciting rock & roller out there. His television appearances and stage shows were legendary for their manic energy, and his competitive nature to outdo anyone else on the bill led to the story about how he once set his piano on fire at set's end to make it impossible for Chuck Berry to follow his act. Nobody messed with the Killer.\nJerry Lee's follow-up to \"Shakin'\" was another defining moment for his career, as well as for rock & roll. \"Great Balls of Fire\" featured only piano and drums, but sounded huge with Phillips' production behind it. It got him into a rock & roll movie (Jamboree) and his fame was spreading to such a degree that Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins left Sun to go to Columbia Records. His next single, \"Breathless,\" had a promotional tie-in with Dick Clark's Saturday night Bandstand show, making it three hits in a row for the newcomer.\nBut Lewis was sowing the seeds of his own destruction in record time. He sneaked off and married his 13-year-old cousin, Myra Gale Brown, the daughter of his bass-playing uncle, J.W. Brown. With the Killer insisting that she accompany him on a debut tour of England, the British press got wind of the marriage and proceeded to crucify him in the press. The tour was canceled and Lewis arrived back in the U.S. to find his career in absolute disarray. His records were banned nationwide by radio stations and his booking price went from $10,000 a night to $250 in any honky tonk that would still have him. Undeterred, he kept right on doing what he had been doing, head unbowed and determined to make it back to the bigs, Jerry Lee Lewis style. It took him almost a dozen years to pull it off, but finally, with a sympathetic producer and a new record company willing to exact a truce with country disc jockeys, the Killer found a new groove, cutting one hit after another for Smash Records throughout the late '60s into the '70s. Still playing rock & roll on-stage whenever the mood struck him (which was often) while keeping all his releases pure country struck a creative bargain that suited Lewis well into the mid-'70s.\nBut while his career was soaring again, his personal life was falling apart. The next decade-and-a-half saw several marriages fall apart (starting with his 13-year-long union with Myra), the deaths of his parents and oldest son, battles with the I.R.S., and bouts with alcohol and pills that frequently left him hospitalized. Suddenly, the Ferriday Fireball was nearing middle age and the raging fire seemed to be burned out.\n\nBut the mid-'80s saw another jump start to his career. A movie entitled Great Balls of Fire was about to be made of his life and Lewis was called in to sing the songs for the soundtrack. Showing everyone who was the real Killer, Lewis sounded energetic enough to make you believe it was 1957 all over again with the pilot light of inspiration still burning bright. He also got a boost back to major-label land with a one-song appearance on the soundtrack for Dick Tracy. In 2006, Lewis released Last Man Standing, which featured duets with Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Willie Nelson, Rod Stewart, Jimmy Page, and others. He followed it up in 2010 with another album of duets, Mean Old Man, which saw Lewis teaming with Eric Clapton, Merle Haggard, John Fogerty, and Kid Rock, among others. With box sets and compilations, documentaries, a bio flick, and his induction to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame all celebrating his legacy, Lewis still continued to record and tour, delivering work that vacillated from tepid to absolutely inspired. While his influence will continue to loom large until there's no one left to play rock & roll piano anymore, the plain truth is that there's only one Jerry Lee Lewis and American music will never see another like him.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Jewel Kilcher (born May 23, 1974 in Payson, Utah, United States) is a singer, songwriter, actress, and poet, generally known just by her first name, Jewel. She has received four Grammy Award nominations.\n\nJewel is the daughter of Nedra Carroll, an artist and personal manager, and Atz Kilcher, an elementary school music teacher, folk singer and social worker. Her mother of Irish descent and her father is of Swiss-German origin. She is the cousin of actress Q'Orianka Kilcher. She spent most of her young life in Homer, Alaska, United States, living with her father. The home she grew up in did not have indoor plumbing; it had a simple outhouse instead. She and her father sometimes earned a living by singing in bars and taverns. It was from these experiences she learned to yodel, a quality demonstrated in many of her songs. Her father was a Mormon, but they stopped attending the church shortly before she turned eight. Yule Kilcher, her grandfather, was a state senator involved in drafting Alaska's constitution for its admission into a state from a territory in 1959.\n\nDuring high school, Jewel was known to spell her name \"Jule\" or \"Juel,\" but she attributes this to simply playing with her name.\n\nJewel learned to play the guitar while at the Interlochen Arts Academy in Interlochen, Michigan, United States where she majored in operatic voice. She started writing songs at the age of seventeen.\n\nFor a time, she was poverty-stricken and lived in her van while traveling about the country doing street performances and small gigs. She gained some recognition by singing at the Innerchange Coffeehouse and Java Joe's in San Diego, California, United States. Her friend Steve Poltz's band, The Rugburns, played at the same venues. Jewel later collaborated with Poltz on some of her songs, including \"You Were Meant For Me\" (He also appeared in the second, best-known, video for this song). The Rugburns opened for Jewel on her Tiny Lights tour in 1997. Poltz appeared in Jewel's band on the Spirit World Tour 1999 playing guitar.\n\nIn 1993, Michael Balzary (better known by the stage name – Flea) of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers met Jewel after he saw her perform at a local cafe. He went back to her van where she was living, where she sang a few of her songs to him. He described her singing voice as being \"beautiful\" and \"breathtaking\".\n\nJewel was discovered by Inga Vainshtein in August 1993, when a musician from a local San Diego band, Rust, whom Vainshtein was managing at the time, called to tell her about a girl surfer who sang at a local coffee shop on Thursdays. Vainshtein drove to Innerchange coffee shop with a rep from Atlantic Records, and after the show they called Danny Goldberg, the head of Atlantic Records west coast operations, and asked him to pay for Jewel's demo. Vainshtein eventually became Jewel's manager, and was instrumental in creating a major bidding war, which led to Jewel's deal with Atlantic Records. She cut her debut album, Pieces of You, when she was nineteen and it was released in 1995. Jewel recorded \"Pieces of You\" in a studio on Neil Young's ranch, and was backed by his band, The Stray Gators, who played on Neil Young's \"Harvest\" and \"Harvest Moon\" albums. Part of the album was cut live at the Innerchange Coffeehouse in San Diego where she had risen to local fame. The album stayed on the Billboard 200 for an impressive two years, reaching number four at its peak. The album spawned the Top 10 hits \"You Were Meant for Me\", \"Who Will Save Your Soul\" and \"Foolish Games\". The album was a huge success and eventually sold over 12 million copies in the United States. alone, more than all of her subsequent albums put together.\n\nDue to her successes, she was chosen to sing the American national anthem at the opening of the Super Bowl in January 1998 in San Diego. She was introduced as \"San Diego's own Jewel!\" However, she was criticized for lip-syncing the anthem to a pre-recording. This was especially noticeable due to her missing her cue and not mouthing the first words.\n\nIn November 1998, Jewel released her second album, Spirit. The album peaked at #3 on the Billboard 200 and sold over 4 million copies in the United States. The songs \"Hands\" and \"Down So Long\" hit the Top 10. Other singles followed, a new version of \"Jupiter (Swallow The Moon)\", \"What's Simple Is True\", the theme song to her upcoming movie, and the charity single \"Life Uncommon\".\n\nA year later, In November 1999, Jewel released Joy: A Holiday Collection. The album sold over a million copies and peaked at #32 on the Billboard 200. She released a cover of \"Joy to the World\" from the album.\n\nIn November 2001, the album This Way was released. The album peaked at #9 on the Billboard 200 and sold over 1 million copies in the United States, standing as her most critically acclaimed album to date. Jewel hit the Top 10 with the song \"Standing Still\" and the Top 40 with the song \"Break Me\". Other singles released were \"This Way\" and \"Serve The Ego\", the latter giving Jewel her first number one club hit.\n\nIn 2003, Jewel released the album 0304. She writes in the liner notes, \"I wanted to make a record that was a modern interpretation of big band music. A record that was lyric driven, like Cole Porter, that also had a lot of swing. And a lot of it is thanks to Lester, because when I told him I wanted to make a record that combined dance, urban, and folk music, he didn't look at me like I was crazy.\" While some fans considered 0304 an innovative album that held to the tradition of her previous albums, others felt that it was too much of a departure from the style of her previous albums. Following the limited success of \"Serve the Ego\", Jewel moved to a more pop-oriented sound with the release of the single \"Intuition\". The song, which strays from her usual folk style with simple guitar instrumentation, starts off with a French accordion and experiments with pop beats using synthesizers. The song was successful, reaching #5 on the Billboard Adult Top 40. However, a number of Jewel's fans criticized her for abandoning her traditional folk style in exchange for a new pop sound. Accusations of \"selling out\" for personal gain, among other things, were made. Despite the different sound style, the song is lyrically similar to her previous work. It has a number of references to culture, including mentioning celebrities such as pop star Jennifer Lopez, model Kate Moss, magazines, film culture and commercialism.\n\nOn May 2, 2006, Jewel released her sixth album, Goodbye Alice In Wonderland. The album received mixed reviews, but still managed to debut at #8 on the Billboard Albums Chart. The album sold 82,000 copies in its first week out. The lead single \"Again and Again\" has had moderate success on Adult Top 40 Radio, peaking at #16. The second single, \"Good Day\", was released to radio in late June but failed to gain any traction on the radio airplay charts. Later, a video for \"Stephenville, TX\", her next single, has been seen on Yahoo! Launch.\n\nAs of December 2006, the album barely sold 270,000 copies. It is notable in that it is the only Jewel album not to achieve Gold certification, even though it has been hailed as arguably one of her best albums. As one music critic, Timothy Duggan, notes: \"This album showcases Jewel's unique talent as a lyricist, alongside a definite growth in her musicianship. It is what 'Pieces of You' might have been had Jewel had the musical knowledge then that she has now. A very satisfying work, all in all\". Rolling Stone however, called the album \"overdone and undercooked\" with a rating of 2 stars out of 5.\n\nIn early February 2007, Jewel recorded a duet with Jason Michael Carroll, \"No Good in Goodbye (With Jewel)\", that was featured on Carroll's debut CD, \"Waitin' in the Country\". She also made a promotional appearance on the T in Boston for the Verizon Yellow Pages, playing songs on a moving subway car and then doing an hour-long acoustic concert in South Station for a large crowd of adoring fans. In an interview with the Boston Globe, Jewel confirmed that she is no longer affiliated with a record label, confirming rumors that Atlantic Records failed to renew her contract after the lackluster sales of her then-latest album. She also hinted that she would like to do a country album next. She is working with John Rich of Big & Rich fame. He says that she is \"probably one of the greatest American singer-songwriters we have had\". He also said that \"every label in Nashville\" is talking to her now.\n\nIn November 2007, Jewel was signed to Valory Records, a newly formed division of the independent Big Machine Records label. Her first country album, Perfectly Clear, is currently scheduled for release on June 3, 2008; its lead single, Stronger Woman was released to country radio on January 17, 2008, and has entered the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. As of the April 26, 2008 country charts, the single was #13 on the charts, which is its peak position thus far.\n\nShe will tour with Brad Paisley, Chuck Wicks, and Julianne Hough on Paisley's 2008 tour.\n\nOfficial site: www.jeweljk.com\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jewel\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "strBiographyEN" : "James Marshall \"Jimi\" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American musician, singer, and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as \"arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music\".\n\nBorn in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army; he was granted an honorable discharge the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the chitlin' circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: \"Hey Joe\", \"Purple Haze\", and \"The Wind Cries Mary\". He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, Electric Ladyland, reached number one in the US. The double LP was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before his accidental death from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970, at the age of 27.\n\nHendrix was inspired musically by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback. He helped to popularize the use of a wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock, and was the first artist to use stereophonic phasing effects in music recordings. Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented: \"Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.\"\n\nHendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of Melody Maker voted him the Pop Musician of the Year and in 1968, Billboard named him the Artist of the Year and Rolling Stone declared him the Performer of the Year. Disc and Music Echo honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970, Guitar Player named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Rolling Stone ranked the band's three studio albums, Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love, and Electric Ladyland, among the 100 greatest albums of all time, and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth greatest artist of all time.",

The band originally formed with a punk rock sound, first releasing a demo tape in 1993, followed by their first EP in 1994, titled One, Two, Three, Four. Their debut self-titled album (1994) was released with current guitarist Linton singing most of the lead vocals on the album. Jimmy Eat World released both their second and third albums through Capitol Records, with Static Prevails (1996) featuring their first single \"Rockstar\". The critically acclaimed Clarity (1999) contained the single \"Lucky Denver Mint\", which was featured in the film Never Been Kissed and went on to garner a cult following.\n\nThe four piece's commercial breakthrough came with the successful release of several singles from the album Bleed American (2001). Four singles from the album charted within the top 20 of the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, with \"The Middle\" reaching number one. Jimmy Eat World followed up with Futures (2004), featuring another Modern Rock Tracks number one, \"Pain\". The RIAA certified Bleed American platinum and Futures gold, rewarding the two albums for selling over one and a half million records between them.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Singer Joan Osborne was born on July 8, 1962, in the town of Anchorage, KY, but it wasn't until relocating to New York City in the early '90s (to study at NYU's film school) that she began to take a singing career seriously after singing Billie Holiday's classic \"God Bless the Child\" at a local bar's open-mike night. In addition to Holiday, Osborne looked to such legendary vocalists as Etta James and Ray Charles as role models, as the up-and-coming singer decided not to cater to major record companies and formed her own label, Womanly Hips, which resulted in such releases as 1992's in-concert Soul Show, among others. But eventually Osborne decided to sign on with a major label, Mercury, which in turn issued the singer's next release, Relish, in March 1995. The album proved to have a long life, as almost a year after its initial release the track \"One of Us\" became a massive MTV and radio smash, camping out at the number one spot on the U.S. singles chart for two weeks, and Relish eventually racked up sales of three million copies. Further tracks (\"Right Hand Man\" and \"St. Teresa\") failed to match the success of Osborne's first hit, but the singer still managed to connect with a large and appreciative audience, especially during touring as part of the 1997 edition of Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair tour. Osborne also received numerous Grammy nominations in both 1996 and 1997.\nEarly Recordings\nProducing a worthy follow-up to Relish proved to be a time-consuming challenge for Osborne. Mercury tried to buy some time by issuing a compilation release, Early Recordings (which collected the early releases Live at Delta '88 and Blue Million Miles). In the meantime, Osborne focused on supporting a few groups/causes she felt strongly about, such as Rock the Vote and Planned Parenthood (eventually being named an honorary member of Planned Parenthood's board of advocates), in addition to covering \"I'm Just a Bill\" as a duet with Isaac Hayes on the 1998 Schoolhouse Rocks the Vote! benefit album. She also studied briefly with late Qawwali master Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and performed alongside such notables as Stevie Wonder, Melissa Etheridge, Taj Mahal, Luciano Pavarotti, Spearhead, Bob Dylan, and the Chieftains. September 2000 finally saw the release of Osborne's next all-new studio album, titled Righteous Love, which failed to match its predecessor's commercial success and sank from sight shortly after release. She bounced back in 2002 with How Sweet It Is, a collection of covers that leaned heavily on classic soul and R&B tunes from the 1960s and '70s. A career retrospective, One of Us, followed in 2005. Vanguard picked her up shortly after this, and Osborne released her first full-length on that label, a country-tinged effort called Pretty Little Stranger, in 2006. It was followed in 2007 by Breakfast in Bed and in 2008 by Little Wild One. After a break of three years, Osborne re-entered a recording studio with her road band and co-producer Jack Petrizelli. They emerged with a raw, wooly collection of classic blues and R&B covers entitled Bring It On Home; it was released in the spring of 2012.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Joe Cocker OBE (* 20. Mai 1944 in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire; † 22. Dezember 2014 in Crawford, Colorado, USA) was one of rock and roll's enduring performers who has survived the sixties, a low period in the seventies, made a comeback in the eighties, and continues to be a solid and consistent performer in the nineties. His gutsy, gravelly, vocal style and unique stage presence make him one of the most dynamic singers in the music industry. \nHe started out in Sheffield, England in the mid sixties, working as gas plumber by day and performing in the clubs of the area by night. After hooking up with another \"Sheffielder,\" Chris Stainton, they recorded \"Marjorine\" - a minor success in the U.K. Shortly thereafter, they recorded \"With a Little Help From My Friends,\" produced by Denny Cordell of A&M Records. This album featured guest performers Jimmy Page, Steve Winwood and Matthew Fischer. It quickly took off and received airplay on both sides of the Atlantic. The title track on the album is arguably Cocker's best, it became a major highlight of the Woodstock Festival in 1969, and surpasses the original recording by the Beatles. After touring the states, he recorded the album, \"Joe Cocker!,\" produced by Leon Russell and Denny Cordell. \nThe album was universally lauded by the critics and featured songs such as \"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window,\" \"Delta Lady,\" \"Darling Be Home Soon,\" and a rollicking rendition of \"Hitchcock Railway.\" After two years of constant touring, Cocker was ready for a break and wanted to go home. This, however, was not to be the case. He had made commitments to appear in concerts throughout the states and the U.S. Immigration Department said the contracts must be honored or he was in danger of never being able to work again in America. With some help from Leon Russell, a motley group of talented musicians was quickly formed to fulfill the promised concert dates. \nThe \"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\" tour produced an album and a movie detailing the zaniness and the circus-like atmosphere of the forty three person entourage. They whipped through thiry nine cities in a little less than two months. After this endeavor, Cocker was physically exhausted, emotionally drained, and in trouble legally and financially. He went into seclusion, travelling in his van around England, making an attempt to find himself again.\n In the ensuing years, 1971 - 1974, there were numerous reports of alcohol and drug abuse. His episodes of public drunkeness were as well known as his talents, and the music industry mavens had written Cocker off as \"washed up, an early burn-out.\" The albums released during this period included \"Joe Cocker,\" \"I Can Stand a Little Rain,\" \"Stingray,\" and \"Jamaica, Say You Will.\" None of them were artistically great, nor did they come close to the commercial successes of his previous releases. There were some songs that received airplay, \"High Time We Went,\" \"Fun Time,\" \"Put Out the Light,\" and \"You Are So Beautiful.\" There was a period of about four years where he didn't record at all; instead, he toured constantly, playing mostly small clubs to pay the bills and to satisfy his need to perform. \nJoe then left A&M to record an album for Asylum Records and his career was once again on the upswing. \"A Luxury You Can Afford\" had some great tunes on it - \"Watch the River Flow,\" \"Fun Time,\" and a marvelous cover of \"Heard It Through the Grapevine.\" The following release \"Sheffield Steel,\" showcased Cocker at his very best. The album is so well rounded, covering everything from get-down rock and roll to soul-searing gospel. The most notable cuts on this one are: \"Many Rivers to Cross,\" \"Seven Days,\" \"Sweet Little Woman,\" and \"Just Like Always.\" The later releases from Joe Cocker include: \"Civilized Man,\" \"Cocker Live,\" \"Unchain My Heart,\" \"One Night of Sin,\" and \"Have a Little Faith.\" These releases have earned him four consecutive Grammy nominations for best male rock vocal performance. \nIn 1995, A&M Records released \"The Long Voyage Home,\" a four CD box-set with material, some previously unreleased, that encompasses the highlights of Joe's career. This album is a must have for any Cocker fan. Sony Music has recently released the \"Organic\" album. On this one, many of Joe's hits have been reworked, giving them an entirely new sound. Some notable cuts include \"Anybody Seen My Girl, You and I\" and an outstanding \"You Are So Beautiful.\" Joe Cocker's ability to take a song, rework it from his soul and make it entirely his own is a talent that few performers in the music industry have. His career has been full of ups and downs but he continues to be one of rock music's strongest assets.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr. (December 31, 1943 - October 12, 1997), known professionally as John Denver, was an American singer/songwriter, activist, and humanitarian. After traveling and living in numerous locations while growing up in his military family, Denver began his music career in folk music groups in the late 1960s. His greatest commercial success was as a solo singer. Throughout his life Denver recorded and released approximately 300 songs, about 200 of which he composed. He performed primarily with an acoustic guitar and sang about his joy in nature, his enthusiasm for music, and relationship trials. Denver's music appeared on a variety of charts including country and western, the Billboard Hot 100, and adult contemporary, in all earning him 12 gold and 4 platinum albums with his signature songs \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\", \"Rocky Mountain High\", and \"Sunshine on My Shoulders\".\nDenver further starred in films and several notable television specials in the 1970s and 1980s. In the following decades he continued to record, but also focused on calling attention to environmental issues, lent his vocal support to space exploration, and testified in front of Congress to protest censorship in music. He was known for his love of the state of Colorado, which he sang about numerous times. He lived in Aspen, Colorado, for much of his life, and influenced the governor to name him Poet Laureate of the state in 1974. The Colorado state legislature also adopted \"Rocky Mountain High\" as one of its state songs in 2007. He was an avid pilot, and died while flying his personal aircraft at the age of 53. Denver was one of the most popular acoustic artists of the 1970s.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "John Winston Ono Lennon MBE (9 October 1940 – 8 December 1980) was an English singer, songwriter and peace activist who co-founded the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music. He and fellow member Paul McCartney formed a much-celebrated songwriting partnership. Along with George Harrison and Ringo Starr, the group achieved worldwide fame during the 1960s. In 1969, Lennon started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, Yoko Ono, and he continued to pursue a solo career following the Beatles' break-up in April 1970.\n\nBorn John Winston Lennon in Liverpool, he became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1957, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Further to his Plastic Ono Band singles such as \"Give Peace a Chance\" and \"Instant Karma!\", Lennon subsequently produced albums that included John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, and songs such as \"Working Class Hero\", \"Imagine\" and \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\". After moving to New York City in 1971, he never returned to England again. In 1975, he disengaged himself from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the album Double Fantasy. He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building three weeks after the album's release.\n\nLennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. He was controversial through his political and peace activism. From 1971 onward, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. Some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.\n\nBy 2012, Lennon's solo album sales in the United States had exceeded 14 million units. He had 25 number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart as a writer, co-writer or performer. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons and in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time. In 1987, he was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Lennon was twice posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: first in 1988 as a member of the Beatles and again in 1994 as a solo artist.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers was formed in January 1963 and became an ever-evolving lineup of more than 100 different combinations of musicians performing under that name. Eric Clapton joined in April 1965 just a few months after the release of their first album. Clapton brought guitar-led blues influences to the forefront of the group; he had left The Yardbirds in order to concentrate on the blues.\n\nThe first single released by John Mayall and his band, in May 1964, was the song \"Crawling Up a Hill\" with \"Mr. James\" as the b-side, the band on the single were Peter Ward, John McVie on bass, Bernie Watson on guitar, and Martin Hart on drums. After the single release Bernie Watson was replaced by Roger Dean and Martin Hart was replaced by Hughie Flint. This line-up played with John on John Mayall Plays John Mayall. After this the band released a single called \"Crocodile Walk\" with \"Blues City Shakedown\" as the b-side. The single was produced by Decca producer Tony Clarke. Roger Dean then left the group and was replaced by Eric Clapton.\n\nThe group lost their record contract with Decca that year, which also saw the release of a single called \"I'm Your Witchdoctor\" (produced by Jimmy Page) in October 1965, the first credited to John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers, followed by a return to Decca in 1966. Then in August 1966 The Bluesbreakers released the single \"Lonely Years\" with the b-side \"Bernard Jenkins\", which was released by Purdah Records. The album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton was released in July; it reached the Top Ten in the UK.\n\nShortly after Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton was released Eric Clapton went to see Buddy Guy in concert, and being impressed by his trio, the idea for Cream was formed and he left to form this new group with Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce. Clapton was replaced by Peter Green for A Hard Road, after which he left to form Fleetwood Mac.\n\nThen Mick Taylor joined the group and they recorded Crusade on 12 July 1967. Soon after, McVie joined Fleetwood Mac and was replaced by Tony Reeves for the album Bare Wires which was their highest charting UK album. Taylor then left to join The Rolling Stones and the name \"Bluesbreakers\" was dropped from John Mayall albums.\n\nBy the time the 1960s were over, the Bluesbreakers had finally achieved some success in the United States.\n\nWith some interruptions, the Bluesbreakers have continued to tour and release albums (over 50 to date), though they never achieved the critical or popular acclaim of their earlier material. In 2003, Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor and Chris Barber reunited with the band for John Mayall's 70th Birthday Concert in Liverpool — the concert was later released on CD and DVD. In 2004, their line up included Buddy Whittington, Joe Yuele, Hank Van Sickle and Tom Canning, and the band toured the UK with Mick Taylor as a guest musician.\n\nIn November 2008, Mayall announced on his website he was disbanding the Bluesbreakers, to cut back on his heavy workload and give himself freedom to work with other musicians. A 2009 solo tour with Rocky Athas (formerly of Black Oak Arkansas) was the first musical venture Mayall undertook after disbanding his former band. Former band member, Johnny Almond died on 18 November 2009 from cancer, aged 63.\n\nHowever, in 2009, Eagle Records asked Mayall for a new album, and he put together a new band including Rocky Athas (guitar), Tom Canning (keyboard), Greg Rzab (bass) and Jay Davenport (percussion), and produced the album Tough the same year. After a year Canning left for other priorities.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Johnny Cash was one of the most imposing and influential figures in post-World War II country music. With his deep, resonant baritone and spare percussive guitar, he had a basic, distinctive sound. Cash didn't sound like Nashville, nor did he sound like honky tonk or rock & roll. He created his own subgenre, falling halfway between the blunt emotional honesty of folk, the rebelliousness of rock & roll, and the world-weariness of country. Cash's career coincided with the birth of rock & roll, and his rebellious attitude and simple, direct musical attack shared a lot of similarities with rock. However, there was a deep sense of history -- as he would later illustrate with his series of historical albums -- that kept him forever tied with country. And he was one of country music's biggest stars of the '50s and '60s, scoring well over 100 hit singles.\nCash, whose birth name was J.R. Cash, was born and raised in Arkansas, moving to Dyess when he was three. By the time he was 12 years old, he had begun writing his own songs. He was inspired by the country songs he had heard on the radio. While he was in high school, he sang on the Arkansas radio station KLCN. Cash graduated from high school in 1950, moving to Detroit to work in an auto factory for a brief while. With the outbreak of the Korean War, he enlisted in the Air Force. While he was in the Air Force, Cash bought his first guitar and taught himself to play. He began writing songs in earnest, including \"Folsom Prison Blues.\" Cash left the Air Force in 1954, married a Texas woman named Vivian Leberto, and moved to Memphis, where he took a radio announcing course at a broadcasting school on the GI Bill. During the evenings, he played country music in a trio that also consisted of guitarist Luther Perkins and bassist Marshall Grant. The trio occasionally played for free on a local radio station, KWEM, and tried to secure gigs and an audition at Sun Records.\nCash finally landed an audition with Sun Records and its founder, Sam Phillips, in 1955. Initially, Cash presented himself as a gospel singer, but Phillips turned him down. Phillips asked him to come back with something more commercial. Cash returned with \"Hey Porter,\" which immediately caught Phillips' ear. Soon, Cash released \"Cry Cry Cry\"/\"Hey Porter\" as his debut single for Sun. On the single, Phillips billed Cash as \"Johnny,\" which upset the singer because he felt it sounded too young; the record producer also dubbed Perkins and Grant as the Tennessee Two. \"Cry Cry Cry\" became a success upon its release in 1955, entering the country charts at number 14 and leading to a spot on The Louisiana Hayride, where he stayed for nearly a year. A second single, \"Folsom Prison Blues,\" reached the country Top Five in early 1956 and its follow-up, \"I Walk the Line,\" was number one for six weeks and crossed over into the pop Top 20.\n\nCash had an equally successful year in 1957, scoring several country hits including the Top 15 \"Give My Love to Rose.\" Cash also made his Grand Ole Opry debut that year, appearing all in black where the other performers were decked out in flamboyant, rhinestone-studded outfits. Eventually, he earned the nickname of \"The Man in Black.\" Cash became the first Sun artist to release a long-playing album in November of 1957, when Johnny Cash With His Hot and Blue Guitar hit the stores. Cash's success continued to roll throughout 1958, as he earned his biggest hit, \"Ballad of a Teenage Queen\" (number one for ten weeks), as well another number one single, \"Guess Things Happen That Way.\" For most of 1958, Cash attempted to record a gospel album, but Sun refused to allow him to record one. Sun also was unwilling to increase Cash's record royalties. Both of these were deciding factors in the vocalist's decision to sign with Columbia Records in 1958. By the end of the year, he had released his first single for the label, \"All Over Again,\" which became another Top Five success. Sun continued to release singles and albums of unissued Cash material into the '60s.\n\n\"Don't Take Your Guns to Town,\" Cash's second single for Columbia, was one of his biggest hits, reaching the top of the country charts and crossing over into the pop charts in the beginning of 1959. Throughout that year, Columbia and Sun singles vied for the top of the charts. Generally, the Columbia releases -- \"Frankie's Man Johnny,\" \"I Got Stripes,\" and \"Five Feet High and Rising\" -- fared better than the Sun singles, but \"Luther Played the Boogie\" did climb into the Top Ten. That same year, Cash had the chance to make his gospel record -- Hymns by Johnny Cash -- which kicked off a series of thematic albums that ran into the '70s.\nthe Tennessee Two became the Tennessee Three in 1960 with the addition of drummer W.S. Holland. Though he was continuing to have hits, the relentless pace of his career was beginning to take a toll on Cash. In 1959, he had begun taking amphetamines to help him get through his schedule of nearly 300 shows a year. By 1961, his drug intake had increased dramatically and his work was affected, which was reflected by a declining number of hit singles and albums. By 1963, he had moved to New York, leaving his family behind. He was running into trouble with the law, most notably for starting a forest fire out West.\nJune Carter -- who was the wife of one of Cash's drinking buddies, Carl Smith -- would provide Cash with his return to the top of the charts with \"Ring of Fire,\" which she co-wrote with Merle Kilgore. \"Ring of Fire\" spent seven weeks on the top of the charts and was a Top 20 pop hit. Cash continued his success in 1964 as \"Understand Your Man\" became a number one hit. However, Cash's comeback was short-lived as he sank further into addiction, and his hit singles arrived sporadically. Cash was arrested in El Paso for attempting to smuggle amphetamines into the country through his guitar case in 1965. That same year, the Grand Ole Opry refused to have him perform and he wrecked the establishment's footlights. In 1966, his wife Vivian filed for divorce. After the divorce, Cash moved to Nashville. At first, he was as destructive as he ever had been, but he became close friends with June Carter, who had divorced Carl Smith. With Carter's help, he was able to shake his addictions; she also converted Cash to fundamentalist Christianity. His career began to bounce back as \"Jackson\" and \"Rosanna's Going Wild\" became Top Ten hits. Early in 1968, Cash proposed marriage to Carter during a concert; the pair were married that spring.\n\nAlso in 1968, Cash recorded and released his most popular album, Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison. Recorded during a prison concert, the album spawned the number one country hit \"Folsom Prison Blues,\" which also crossed over into the pop charts. By the end of the year, the record had gone gold. The following year, he released a sequel, Johnny Cash at San Quentin, which had his only Top Ten pop single, \"A Boy Named Sue,\" which peaked at number three; it also hit number one on the country charts. Cash guested on Bob Dylan's 1969 country-rock album Nashville Skyline. Dylan returned the favor by appearing on the first episode of The Johnny Cash Show, the singer's television program for ABC. The Johnny Cash Show ran for two years, between 1969 and 1971.\nCash was reaching a second peak of popularity in 1970. In addition to his television show, he performed for President Richard Nixon at the White House, acted with Kirk Douglas in The Gunfight, sang with John Williams and the Boston Pops Orchestra, and he was the subject of a documentary film. His record sales were equally healthy as \"Sunday Morning Coming Down\" and \"Flesh and Blood\" were number one hits. Throughout 1971, Cash continued to have hits, including the Top Three \"Man in Black.\" Both Cash and Carter became more socially active in the early '70s, campaigning for the civil rights of Native Americans and prisoners, as well as frequently working with Billy Graham.\nIn the mid-'70s, Cash's presence on the country charts began to decline, but he continued to have a series of minor hits and the occasional chart-topper like 1976's \"One Piece at a Time,\" or Top Ten hits like the Waylon Jennings duet \"There Ain't No Good Chain Gang\" and \"(Ghost) Riders in the Sky.\" Man in Black, Cash's autobiography, was published in 1975. In 1980, he became the youngest inductee to the Country Music Hall of Fame. However, the '80s were a rough time for Cash as his record sales continued to decline and he ran into trouble with Columbia. Cash, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis teamed up to record The Survivors in 1982, which was a mild success. The Highwaymen -- a band featuring Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson -- released their first album in 1985, which was also moderately successful. The following year, Cash and Columbia Records ended their relationship and he signed with Mercury Nashville. The new label didn't prove to be a success, as the company and the singer fought over stylistic direction. Furthermore, country radio had begun to favor more contemporary artists, and Cash soon found himself shut out of the charts. Nevertheless, he continued to be a popular concert performer.\n\nThe Highwaymen recorded a second album in 1992, and it was more commercially successful than any of Cash's Mercury records. Around that time, his contract with Mercury ended. In 1993, he signed a contract with American Records. His first album for the label, American Recordings, was produced by the label's founder, Rick Rubin, and was a stark, acoustic collection of songs. American Recordings, while not a blockbuster success, revived his career critically and brought him in touch with a younger, rock-oriented audience. In 1995, The Highwaymen released their third album, The Road Goes on Forever. The following year, Cash released his second album for American Records, Unchained, which featured support from Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers. His VH1 Storytellers outing was released in 1998, and in the spring of 2000, Cash compiled Love, God, Murder, a three-disc retrospective focusing on the major songwriting themes dominant throughout his career. The new studio album American III: Solitary Man appeared later that year.\n\nHealth problems plagued Cash throughout the '90s and into the 2000s, but he continued to record with Rubin; their fourth collaboration, American IV: The Man Comes Around, was released in late 2002. The following year, the Mark Romanek-directed video for his cover of Nine Inch Nails' \"Hurt\" garnered considerable acclaim and media attention, culminating in an unexpected nomination for video of the year at the MTV Video Music Awards. Not long after the video sparked numerous stories, his beloved wife June Carter Cash died on May 15, 2003, of complications following heart surgery. Four months later, Johnny died of complications from diabetes in Nashville, TN. He was 71. Five months later, the compilation Legend of Johnny Cash became a Top Ten hit. In 2006 Lost Highway released the next-to-last installment of Cash's legendary \"American\" recordings, American V: A Hundred Highways, from the late singer's last sessions with collaborator Rick Rubin. The final installment from those sessions appeared as American VI: Ain't No Grave, in early 2010, and is reported to be the last of the American Recordings releases. Sony Legacy started a vigorous \"bootleg\" series of rare, unreleased or hard to find Cash tracks in 2011 with the two-disc Bootleg, Vol. 1: Personal File and continued into 2012 with three further two-disc sets of rare material.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "John Royce \"Johnny\" Mathis (born September 30, 1935) is an American singer of popular music. Starting his career with singles of standard music, he became highly popular as an album artist, with several dozen of his albums achieving gold or platinum status and 73 making the Billboard charts. Johnny Mathis has sold over 350 million records worldwide, as confirmed by Guinness Music charts historian Paul Gambacini.\nAlthough he is frequently described as a romantic singer, his discography includes jazz, traditional pop, Brazilian music, Spanish music, soul music, rhythm and blues, soft rock, Broadway theatre, Tin Pan Alley standards, some blues and country songs, and even a few disco songs for his album Mathis Magic in 1979. Mathis also recorded five albums of Christmas music. In a 1968 interview, Mathis cited Lena Horne, Nat King Cole, and Bing Crosby among his musical influences.\nMathis was born in Gilmer, Texas in 1935, the fourth of seven children of Clem Mathis and his wife, Mildred Boyd. The family moved to San Francisco, California, settling on 32nd Ave. in the Richmond District, where Johnny grew up. His father had worked in vaudeville, and when he saw his son's talent, he bought an old upright piano for $25 and encouraged him. Mathis began learning songs and routines from his father. His first song was \"My Blue Heaven.\" Mathis started singing and dancing for visitors at home, at school, and at church functions.\nWhen he was 13, voice teacher Connie Cox accepted him as her student in exchange for work around her house. Johnny studied with Cox for six years, learning vocal scales and exercises, voice production, classical, and operatic singing. He is one of the few popular singers who received years of professional voice training that included opera. The first band he sang with was formed by his high school friend Merl Saunders. Mathis eulogized him at his funeral in 2008, thanking him for giving him his first chance as a singer.\nMathis was a star athlete at George Washington High School in San Francisco. He was a high jumper and hurdler, and he played on the basketball team. In 1954, he enrolled at San Francisco State University on an athletic scholarship, intending to become an English teacher and a physical education teacher.\nMathis was spotted at a jam session by Helen Noga, the former head cocktail waitress and co-owner of the Black Hawk Club in San Francisco and The DownBeat Club, along with her husband John and Guido Caccienti. She became his musical manager. The clubs attracted the world's finest jazz musicians, including Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and Billie Holiday. John Noga and Guido Caccienti had opened the Black Hawk in the fall of 1949. In September 1955, after Noga had found Mathis a job singing weekends at Ann Dee's 440 Club, she contacted the jazz producer George Avakian, who she had found out was on vacation near San Francisco. Avakian came to listen to Mathis sing, and after doing so, he sent a telegram to Columbia Records stating: Have found phenomenal 19-year-old boy who could go all the way. Send blank contracts.\nAt San Francisco State, Mathis had become noteworthy as a high jumper, and in 1956 he was asked to try out for the U.S. Olympic Team that would travel to Melbourne, Australia, that November. Mathis had to decide whether to go to the Olympic trials or to keep his appointment in New York City to make his first recordings. On his father's advice, Mathis opted to embark on a professional singing career. His LP record album was published in late 1956 instead of waiting until the first quarter of 1957.\nMathis's first record album, Johnny Mathis: A New Sound In Popular Song, was a slow-selling jazz album, but Mathis stayed in New York City to sing in nightclubs. His second album was produced by Columbia Records vice-president and record producer Mitch Miller, who helped to define the Mathis sound. Miller preferred that Mathis sing soft, romantic ballads, pairing him up with conductor and music arranger Ray Conniff, and later, Ray Ellis, Glenn Osser, and Robert Mersey. In late 1956, Mathis recorded two of his most popular songs: \"Wonderful! Wonderful!\" and \"It's Not For Me To Say\".\nAlso that year, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer signed him up to sing the latter song in the movie Lizzie (1957). Shortly afterwards, Mathis made his second film appearance for 20th Century Fox, singing the song \"A Certain Smile\" in the film of that title. He had small acting roles in both movies as a bar singer. This early visibility in two successful movies gave him mass exposure. His appearance on the popular TV program The Ed Sullivan Show in 1957 also helped increase his popularity. Critics called him \"the velvet voice\". Mathis also appeared during this period on ABC's The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom, as did fellow African-American entertainers Ella Fitzgerald and Pearl Bailey.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Joni Mitchell, CC (born Roberta Joan Anderson; November 7, 1943) is a Canadian musician, singer songwriter, and painter. Mitchell began singing in small nightclubs in Saskatchewan and Western Canada and then busking in the streets and dives of Toronto. In 1965 she moved to the United States and, touring constantly, began to be recognized when her original songs (\"Urge for Going,\" \"Chelsea Morning,\" \"Both Sides, Now,\" \"The Circle Game\") were covered by notable folk singers, allowing her to sign with Reprise Records and record her own debut album in 1968. Settling in Southern California, Mitchell and her popular songs like \"Big Yellow Taxi\" and \"Woodstock\" helped define an era and a generation. Her more starkly personal 1971 recording Blue has been called one of the best albums ever made. Musically restless, Mitchell switched labels and began moving toward jazz rhythms by way of lush pop textures on 1974's Court and Spark, her best-selling LP, featuring her radio hits \"Help Me\" and \"Free Man in Paris.\"\nMitchell's wide-ranging vocals and her distinctive open-tuned guitar and piano compositions grew more harmonically and rhythmically complex as she explored jazz, melding it with her influences in rock n roll, R&B, classical music and non-western beats. Mitchell's experimental run of jazz-inspired albums, including 1975's The Hissing of Summer Lawns and 1976's Hejira, confused many and hurt Mitchell's sales at the time, but they are acclaimed today. In the late 1970s, she began working closely with noted jazz musicians, among them Jaco Pastorius, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny and Charles Mingus, the last of whom asked her to collaborate on his final recordings. In her later work Mitchell turned again toward pop, embraced electronic music, and engaged in political protest. Mitchell was also the sole record producer credited on most of her albums, including all her work in the 1970s. With roots in visual art, she designed her own album artwork throughout her career. A blunt critic of the music industry, Mitchell quit touring and released her 17th, and reportedly last, album of original songs in 2007. Now based in British Columbia, she describes herself as a \"painter derailed by circumstance.\"\nMitchell has deeply influenced fellow musicians in a diverse range of genres, and her work is highly respected by critics. Allmusic said, \"When the dust settles, Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century,\" and Rolling Stone called her \"one of the greatest songwriters ever.\" Mitchell's lyrics have been noted for their developed poetics, addressing social and environmental ideals alongside individual feelings of romantic longing, confusion, disillusion and joy.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Terius Gray (born March 25, 1975), better known by his stage name Juvenile, is an American rapper, actor, and songwriter. He is also a former member of hip-hop group the Hot Boys. At the age of 19, he began recording raps, releasing his debut album Being Myself in 1995. He became popular when his 1999 single \"Back That Thang Up\" was released. In 2003, he returned to Cash Money to record Juve the Great, spawning the number-one hit \"Slow Motion\". Following this album he again left Cash Money, and in 2006 he was signed to Atlantic Records. He released Reality Check under that label. He released his eighth studio album, titled Cocky & Confident, on December 1, 2009. He released his ninth studio album, titled Beast Mode, on July 6, 2010. \n\nMusic career:\n\nBeginnings:\nJuvenile released the song \"Back That Thang Up\", which was a big hit in the early 2000s. He first began recording his raps in the early 1990s. One of his early recordings was featured on DJ Jimi's 1991 release, \"It's Jimi\". The song \"Bounce For the Juvenile\" was a minor local hit and helped popularize \"bounce music,\" a new rap style emerging out of New Orleans. In his smash hit, \"Back That Thang Up,\" Juvenile included dogs barking as part of the beat for the song. \n\n1994-95: Being Myself:\nJuvenile's debut album, Being Myself, was released in 1995 after signing with Warlock Records. The album did not gain much national attention and did not chart, but did fairly well on a local level. \n\n1997: Solja Rags:\nAfter the regional success of his debut Juvenile signed to the larger Cash Money Records. In 1997 Solja Rags, Juvenile's debut album with Cash Money Records, was released. It became popular among local rap audiences, and also saw some national success as it charted on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It was the first time he worked with Cash Money in-house producer Mannie Fresh, who would go on to produce all of Juvenile's albums on Cash Money in their entirety except Juve the Great. Also in 1997 Juvenile joined the group the Hot Boys with fellow Cash Money rappers B.G., Turk, and Lil Wayne. They released their debut album as a group, titled Get It How U Live! He then left stardom to have babies before he returned in 1998 \n\n1998: 400 Degreez:\nJuvenile's next album, titled 400 Degreez was released in 1998. It was his breakout to the national rap scene. The Cash Money label now had joint distribution by Universal Records, which gave the music much more national promotion. This along with much more critically praised music made Juvenile a mainstream star. The album's first single \"Ha\" and later \"Back That Azz Up\", both became very successful songs charting on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Powered by these two singles 400 Degreez was eventually certified 4X platinum by the RIAA. It is his best selling album to date. However, there came a dispute over who owned the rights to the title of \"Back That Azz Up\", as another New Orleans performer DJ Jubilee claimed that Juvenile's song sounded very similar to a song of his. In January 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans denied the case. \n\n1999-2002: Tha G-Code & Project English:\nIn 1998, capitalizing off Juvenile's popularity off 400 Degreez, a remixed version of Being Myself and reissue of Solja Rags were released. The second Hot Boys group album, Guerrilla Warfare also came out and was successful, being certified Platinum. Over the next few years Juvenile released two more solo albums for Cash Money Tha G-Code in 1999 being certified Double Platinum, and Project English in 2001 being certified Platinum. These albums each were very successful as they both reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 200, but they did not match the success of 400 Degreez. UTP Records had promised an album titled 600 Degreez but it never materialized. \n\n2003-04: Juve the Great & UTP:\nJuvenile's manager Aubrey Francis and Cash Money's Baby met and worked out a deal for Juve and CMR to partner for another album. Juvenile returned to Cash Money Records in 2003, releasing Juve the Great. Juve The Great was certified Platinum, it featured the♙number-one hit \"Slow Motion\" featuring Soulja Slim. It was the only number-one hit for Juvenile and Slim before Slim died in November 2003. It topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart on the week of August 7, 2004. The last Hot Boys album, Let 'Em Burn came out in 2003. \nIn 2005 Juvenile signed a new deal with Atlantic Records for himself, and also a separate label deal for his UTP Records imprint. UTP Records is the label that was started by Juve along with his long time manager Aubrey \"Pied Piper\" Francis, and older brother Corey. The group called \"UTP\" (Juve, Skip, and Wacko) released the hit song \"Nolia Clap\" as part of UTP Records first album release. It was produced by Juve along with producer XL Robertson. Atlantic Records. Juvenile also performed the song \"Booty Language\". It was part of the soundtrack for the movie Hustle And Flow. Juve performed alongside fellow Atlantic artist at the movies premier party in West Hollywood, California. Juvenile's Slidell, Louisiana home was damaged during Hurricane Katrina. Juvenile and fellow New Orleans rapper Master P and other hip hop artists raised funds and supplies for some hurricane victims. He moved to Atlanta briefly after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In Spring 2006 he returned home to New Orleans. \n\n2006: Reality Check:\nReality Check, Juvenile's 2006 album, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, being his first number-one album. It was certified Gold. Production began in May 2005, most of it being done at a Holiday Inn hotel room in New Orleans. Its first single was \"Animal\", followed by \"Rodeo\", \"Get Ya Hustle On\" produced by Donald XL Robertson, \"What's Happenin'\" Produced by Terrence \"Sinista\" Freeman, and \"Way I Be Leanin'\" featuring Mike Jones, Paul Wall, Skip, and Wacko. A portion of the album was recorded with engineer, Stewart Cararas at his studio Paradigm Park Studios in New Orleans. Within one month, the studio suffered the wrath of Hurricane Katrina. Stewart now lives and operates in Los Angeles. On signing to Atlantic, Juvenile criticized his former label Cash Money for not giving him enough creative freedoms as well as Federal Emergency Management Agency over his perceptions over their handling of Hurricane Katrina. Shaheem Reid noted \"Get Ya Hustle On\" as a criticism of the George W. Bush administration handling of the whole Hurricane Katrina Disaster. \n\n2009-2010: Cocky & Confident & Beast Mode:\nIn a 2009 interview with Allhiphop.com writer Han O'Connor, Juvenile stated that his album Cocky & Confident would take a totally different direction from his last project, which was made when he was still \"mourning Katrina.\" He also revealed that he decided to work only with fresh, young producers on the album and discussed his respect for younger artists like Soulja Boy. \nCocky & Confident was released in December 2009. It peaked at #49 on the Billboard 200. It was Juvenile's lowest charting album since 1997. It featured one charting single, \"Gotta Get It\", which peaked at #53 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Singles chart. Following this album's release Juvenile began work on his next album, Beast Mode. This album was released in July 2010. Its first single is titled \"Drop That Thang\". \n\n2011-present: Rejuvenation:\nJuvenile released his tenth studio album Rejuvenation on June 19, 2012, which was distributed by Rap-A-Lot Records. The first single from the album is \"Power\" featuring Rick Ross. Juvenile collaborated with Lil Wayne, DJ Khaled, and Drake for the album. On October 28, 2014 Juvenile announced that he re-signed to Cash Money. \n\nPersonal life:\nJuvenile had a daughter, Jelani, with Joy Deleston. On February 29, 2008, Juvenile's 4-year-old daughter Jelani was shot and killed in her home, along with mother Deleston and older half sister. It was reported that Deleston's oldest child, 17-year-old son Anthony Tyrone Terrell Jr., returned to the home after police arrived and implicated himself in the murder of his mother and siblings. Terrell was charged with three counts of murder and three counts of aggravated assault. Due to his age, he cannot be held to the death penalty in Georgia, and has since been held in the DeKalb County jail. Though Juvenile received some criticism for not attending the funeral for his daughter and her mother, several statements were released that the rapper was \"shocked and devastated\" by the event, and also \"was extremely saddened to hear the reports. As a private matter he has no further comment.\" The rapper stated that he made the decision to not appear at the funeral to prevent subsequent media attention, and was concerned that it would divert attention away from the ceremony. Anthony Tyrone Terrell Jr. was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences after he pleaded guilty to killing Joy Deleston, 39, and her daughters, Micaiah, 11, and Jelani. However, Porter said Terrell won't be eligible for parole for at least 30 years. \n\nLegal troubles:\nIn the summer of 2002, Juvenile was arrested for assaulting his barber over charges that the barber was bootlegging his music. \nIn January 2003, Juvenile was arrested in New Orleans on drug charges. The next month, he was sentenced to 75 hours of community service for a fight outside a nightclub in Miami, Florida from 2001. \nJuvenile was involved in a legal dispute regarding failure to pay child support for his daughter Jelani with Joy Deleston, a deputy sheriff in Gwinnett County, Georgia. A paternity lawsuit was issued by Deleston in 2004, resulting in a DNA test and both parties agreeing that Juvenile was the father of the child. Attorney Randy Kessler represented Juvenile in the case, and stated that the case was resolved peacefully by consent order in 2006. \nOn February 25, 2010, Juvenile was arrested in Arabi, Louisiana. While Juvenile was recording music at a house there, a neighbor called police to report smelling marijuana smoke. He was cited on a misdemeanor charge of marijuana possession and later released on bond. For that charge, he pled guilty in August 2010 and received a suspended three-month jail sentence and six months of probation and paid a $250 fine and court costs. \nOn February 26, 2011, Juvenile was arrested in Sterlington, Louisiana for simple possession and speeding. He is due to appear in court in Ouachita Parish in April. A warrant has been issued for Juvenile's arrest in February 2012, for allegedly failing to pay child support. He faced 90 days behind bars in New Orleans after reportedly skipping payments amounting to $160,000 owed to Dionne Williams, the mother of his 13-year-old son. \nAccording to local media outlets and documents obtained by TMZ, the rap star hasn't been paying child support for over five years. A judge has ruled he can avoid arrest and potential jail time if Juvenile, real name Terius Gray, pays $50,000 immediately.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Kiss (often stylized as KISS) is an American rock band formed in New York City in January 1973. Well known for its members' white and black face paint and flamboyant stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Counting the 1978 solo albums, Kiss has been awarded 28 gold albums to date, the most of any American rock band. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 20 million have been certified by the RIAA and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million albums. The 1973 original lineup of Paul Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar) and Peter Criss (drums) is the most successful.\nWith their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley) and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Stanley became the \"Starchild\" because of his tendency to be referred to as the \"starry-eyed lover\" and \"hopeless romantic\". The \"Demon\" makeup reflected Simmons' cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Frehley's \"Spaceman\" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Criss' \"Catman\" makeup was in accordance with the belief that he had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Because of creative differences, both Criss and Frehley were out of the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes had waned considerably by that point.\nBuoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again, but the band continues with Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer. Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members. Kiss has been named in many \"Top\" lists. They include Number 10 on VH1's '100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock', 9th on 'The Greatest Metal Bands' list by MTV, number one on Hit Paraders's \"Top 100 Live Bands\", 56th on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists Of All Time\", and 26th on Gibson's \"50 Greatest American Rock Bands\". Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible. However, on December 15, 2009, it was announced that Kiss did not make it in.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "KRS-One (born Lawrence Parker on August 20, 1965 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, New York) is an American hip-hop MC. Over his career he has been known by several pseudonyms, including Kris Parker, KRS One, KRS-ONE (as given at his site), The Blastmaster and The Teacha. KRS-One is an acronym for “Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody”. KRS-One is a significant figure in the hip hop community and is often referenced in works by other hip hop artists and critics as being the ‘essence’ of an MC and one of the greatest to ever hold the mic.\n\nKRS-One, originally a member of the hip hop crew Boogie Down Productions, is known for setting the path for both hardcore rap and socially conscious political rap.\n\nYouth and early career\n\nBorn Lawrence Parker in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1965, the future KRS-One grew up with his brother Kenny and their single mother in assorted inner city neighborhoods of Brooklyn and the Bronx. According to interviews with The Source Magazine, one fateful day when he was 12 years old, he and his brother Kenny prepared a pan of flavored rice, which was to be the family’s dinner for the evening. The hungry pair ate the whole thing, and when their mother came home from work, she kicked them out of the apartment in a fit of anger. They stayed away for two days before younger Kenny decided to go back home, while Lawrence opted not to return. He spent the better part of the next seven years homeless, much of it at local libraries.\n\nIn his late teen years, Lawrence Parker fell in with some illegal drug dealers and became a courier. Using a bread delivery truck as a cover, Parker and his partner drove around town to make drops. During one of their trips, a police car pulled up behind them with flashing lights. Parker’s partner panicked, and led the cops on a chase for several miles which ended with the truck crashing and the two being apprehended. At the trial, the judge made the commentary that the only reason the police had initially tried to pull them over was because they had private plates on a commercial vehicle, there was no original intent to search for drugs.\n\nParker, still a minor, claimed he was a ward of the state, and got sent to a juvenile home for his sentencing, after which he was moved to a Covenant House youth homeless shelter. It was there that he met Scott Sterling, a recent college graduate who just started working at the shelter as a social worker. Parker discovered that Sterling moonlighted as a hip hop DJ under the name Scott La Rock. By this time, Parker had earned the nickname “Kris” from the relationship he had developed with local Hare Krishnas that evangelized near the shelter. Heavily influenced by Eastern philosophies, he was also an aspiring rapper, and practiced routines in verbal spars with the other shelter residents.\n\nParker and Sterling, along with two other fellows, decided to form a rap group together, initially calling themselves “Scott La Rock and the Celebrity Three”. That was short-lived, however, as the two peripheral members quit, leaving Parker (now calling himself KRS-One) and Sterling. They then decided to call themselves “Boogie Down Productions”. Success is the Word, a 12-inch single release on indie Fresh/Sleeping Bag Records (under the group name “12:41”) did not enjoy commercial success. Soon after, the pair approached another NY indie, Rock Candy Productions, for a deal. As it turns out, the entertainment company was allegedly a front for a pornography operation, but Parker and Sterling convinced the boss to front them the money to record an album, under the newly created subsidiary label, B-Boy Records. After a few 12-inch single releases, the Criminal Minded album finally surfaced in 1987.\n\nCriminal Minded featured many dis tracks that attacked other hip hop emcees and tracks about street crime (“wa da da deng wa da da da deng, listen to my nine millimeter go bang”). KRS One and La Rock appeared on the cover of the album holding firearms, a controversial precedent that would be followed by many rap artists in the years to follow. Musically, the album was based around James Brown samples and reggae influences. They also sampled hard-rock band AC/DC on “Dope Beat”. During these years, KRS-One was also famously involved in a hip hop battle with MC Shan, of Queensbridge. KRS objected to MC Shan calling Queensbridge the home of hip hop, and attacked him viciously on a seminal battle rap, The Bridge Is Over.\n\nLater career and emphasis on political issues\n\nFollowing the fatal shooting of Scott La Rock in 1987, Boogie Down Productions (BDP) became increasingly political. KRS One was the primary motivation behind the HEAL compilation and the Stop the Violence Movement. KRS One attracted many prominent emcees to appear on the 12-inch single “Self Destruction.” As Parker adopted this more conscientious, less violent approach, he stopped calling himself “The Blastmaster” (his battle rap nickname), and instead began calling himself “The Teacha”, turning the nickname KRS-ONE into the backronym “Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone”.\n\nOn his first solo album, 1993’s Return of the Boombap, KRS worked together with producers DJ Premier (Gang Starr), Showbiz and Kid Capri. The catchy yet very hardcore track “Sound of da Police” is featured on this album. His second album, KRS One featured Channel Live on the track “Free Mumia”, a political protest song about Mumia Abu-Jamal, an imprisoned African-American and Black Panther member who a vocal group of activists on the political Left claim is innocent of the crime of which he was convicted. Other prominent guest artists on KRS One included Mad Lion, Busta Rhymes, Das EFX and Fat Joe.\n\nIn 1997, Parker surprised many with his release of the album I Got Next. The record included a remix of the single “Step into a World” which featured a sample from the 1970s rock group Blondie by commercial rap icon Puff Daddy. “Heartbeat”, featuring Angie Martinez and Redman, was based on the old school classic “Feel the Heartbeat” by the Treacherous Three. These collaborations with notably mainstream artists took many fans and observers of the vehemently anti-mainstream KRS One by surprise. However, in August 1997 KRS One appeared on Tim Westwood’s BBC Radio 1 show and vociferously denounced the DJ and the radio station more generally, accusing them of ignoring his style of hip-hop in favour of commercial artists such as Puff Daddy.\n\nIn 1999, there were tentative plans to release an album called “Maximum Strength”; a lead single, “5 Boroughs”, was released on The Corruptor movie soundtrack. However, KRS apparently decided to abort the album’s planned release, just as he had secured a position as a Vice-President of A&R at Reprise Records. KRS moved to southern California, and stayed there for two years, finally ending his relationship with Jive Records with A Retrospective in 2000. The next year, he resigned his position at Reprise and in 2001 The Sneak Attack was released on Koch Records. In 2002, he released a gospel-rap album, Spiritual Minded, surprising many longtime fans. Parker had once denounced Christianity as a “slavemaster religion” which African-Americans should not follow. He founded the Temple of Hiphop, and released a new album, Kristyles, in mid- 2003, which was preceded by KRS-One: The Mixtape. In the summer of 2004 he released Keep Right.\n\nKRS One’s latest CD Life, was released in June 2006, and another CD, Adventures in Emceein on Koch Records is slated for later in the year. KRS has also confirmed for his next album of new material, expected to be out in 2007, he will be working with Marley Marl.\n\nSeptember 11 comments and ensuing controversy\n\nIn 2004, KRS engendered a controversy when he was quoted in a panel discussion hosted by New Yorker Magazine as saying that Blacks “cheered when 911 happened”. The comment drew criticism from many sources, including a pointed barb by the New York Daily News that called Parker an “anarchist” and said that “If Osama bin Laden ever buys a rap album, he’ll probably start with a CD by KRS-One.”\n\nParker responded to the furor surrounding his comments with an editorial written for AllHipHop.com. In it, Parker said “I was asked about why hiphop has not engaged the current situation more (meaning 911), my response was ‘because it does not affect us, or at least we don’t perceive that it affects us, 911 happened to them’. I went on to say that ‘I am speaking for the culture now; I am not speaking my personal opinion.’ I continued to say; ‘911 affected them down the block; the rich, the powerful those that are oppressing us as a culture. Sony, RCA or BMG, Universal, the radio stations, Clear Channel, Viacom with BET and MTV, those are our oppressors those are the people that we’re trying to overcome in hiphop everyday, this is a daily thing. We cheered when 911 happened in New York and say that proudly here. Because when we were down at the trade center we were getting hit over the head by cops, told that we can’t come in this building, hustled down to the train station because of the way we dressed and talked, and so on, we were racially profiled. So, when the planes hit the building we were like, ‘mmmm, justice’. And just as I began to say ‘now of course a lot of our friends and family were lost there as well’ but I was interrupted…”",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Kaiser Chiefs are an indie rock band from Leeds who formed in 1996. They were named after the South African football club Kaizer Chiefs. The name was chosen as the band were big Leeds United fans and their favourite player was Lucas Radebe, the club captain, who had signed for Leeds United from the Kaiser Chiefs. The group's debut album, Employment, was released in 2005. It was primarily inspired by New Wave and punk rock music of the late 1970s and 1980s, and enjoyed international success with over three million copies sold. In 2005, the album was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize. Kaiser Chiefs' second album, Yours Truly, Angry Mob (2007), yielded \"Ruby\", a number one single in the United Kingdom. They released their third album, Off with Their Heads, in October 2008. After a three-year hiatus, they released The Future Is Medieval in June 2011.\n\nWhen they were around eleven years old, Nick Hodgson, Nick Baines and Simon Rix met in the same class at St. Mary's Catholic High School, Menston, West Yorkshire. After leaving school, Rix and Baines left for university in 1996 whereas Hodgson remained in the Leeds area, meeting both Andrew White and Ricky Wilson. Hodgson, White and Wilson formed the band Runston Parva, its name a deliberate misspelling of a small East Yorkshire hamlet called Ruston Parva. After Runston Parva failed to secure a record deal, the group re-formed as Parva upon the return of Rix and Baines from university. Parva's career went beyond the boundaries of Leeds, and the band was able to obtain both a record and publishing deal. However, after Beggars Banquet closed the Mantra label, Parva were dropped and left desolate and without any direction after the release of an album and three singles (\"Heavy\", \"Good Bad Right Wrong\" and \"Hessles\").\n\nAccording to manager James Sandom in an interview with HitQuarters, as a dropped band they had become damaged goods, \"No one would touch them because they had a history. A lot of people used their history against them.\" The band decided that they would aim for a longer term record deal and started afresh with new songs and a new name: Kaiser Chiefs. The new name was taken from South African football club Kaizer Chiefs.\n\nManager James Sandom was tipped off about the band by Drowned in Sound founder Sean Adams for the Drowned in Sound label and persuaded him to go and see them live. Sandom said: \"I went to see a couple of shows and you were just bombarded by a series of potential hit singles.\" Soon after Sandom became their manager, Kaiser Chiefs signed to B-Unique Records. Atlantic Records had also made an offer for the band.",

The band's original members were vocalist Tom Meighan, guitarist and backing vocalist Sergio Pizzorno, and bassist Chris Edwards. \n\nThe band's line-up was completed by Jay Mehler in 2006, replacing guitarist Christopher Karloff, and drummer Ian Matthews in 2004 after a string of session drummers. Kasabian have released four studio albums - Kasabian (2004), Empire (2006), West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum (2009), and Velociraptor! (2011).\n\nThe band's music has been described as a mix between The Stone Roses and Primal Scream with the swagger of Oasis. Their music has won them several awards and recognition in the media, and their live performances are generally lauded.\n\nThe band was formerly called Saracuse and started recording at Bedrock Studios in Leicester where Chris Edwards worked as an engineer. The original band members all hailed from Countesthorpe and Blaby, and the band formed while Pizzorno and Meighan were attending Countesthorpe Community College. The influence of The Stone Roses can be heard in their first jams. The first demo EP was produced by Scott Gilbert and handed to the band late on 24 December 1998. Three songs were recorded live: 'Whats Going On', 'Life of Luxury' and 'Shine On'. Their first public appearance was at the Vipers Rugby Club to celebrate Edwards' 18th birthday with family and friends. The band were soon spotted and changed their name to Kasabian, after Linda Kasabian, a member of the Charles Manson cult (aka the Manson \"family\") famous for serving as his getaway driver. In an interview with Ukula, bassist Chris Edwards explained how the former guitarist Chris Karloff picked the name. Reading up on Charles Manson, the Kasabian name stuck with Karloff. \"He just thought the word was cool, it literally took about a minute after the rest of us heard it... so it was decided,\" says Edwards. Kasabian is a common Armenian surname, originated from the Arabic word, Kasab, meaning a butcher or slaughterer, and suffix (ending) -ian.",

She has since released ten albums, three of which topped the UK Albums Chart, and has had 25 UK Top 40 hit singles including the Top 10 hits \"Wuthering Heights\", \"Running Up that Hill\", \"King of the Mountain\", \"Babooshka\", \"The Man with the Child in His Eyes\", and \"Don't Give Up\".\n In 1987, she won a Brit Award for Best British Female Solo Artist, and in 2002, her songwriting ability was recognised with an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. During the course of her career, she has also been nominated for three Grammy Awards. After her 1979 tour - the only concert tour of her career - Bush released the 1980 album Never for Ever, which made her the first British solo female artist to top the UK album charts and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at Number 1. She is also the first (and to date only) female artist to have Top 5 albums in the UK charts in 5 successive decades.\n In May 2012, Bush's latest album, 50 Words for Snow, won the South Bank Arts Award.

The group currently comprises Tim Rice-Oxley (piano, synthesisers, backing vocals), Richard Hughes (drums, percussion, backing vocals), Jesse Quin (bass guitar, electric guitar, backing vocals) and Tom Chaplin (lead vocals, acoustic guitar). Their original line-up included founder and guitarist Dominic Scott, who left in 2001.\nKeane achieved mainstream success with the release of their debut album, Hopes and Fears, in 2004. The album won multiple awards and was the second best-selling British album of the year. Their second studio album, Under the Iron Sea, continued the band's success, topping the album charts in the UK and debuting at No.4 on the Billboard 200 chart. Their third album, Perfect Symmetry was released in October 2008. In May 2008, both Hopes and Fears (number 13) and Under the Iron Sea (number 8) were voted by readers of Q magazine as among the best British albums ever, with Keane, The Beatles, Oasis and Radiohead the only artists having two albums in the top 20. Their EP, Night Train, was released in May 2010. Their fourth studio album, Strangeland, was released in May 2012, and again peaked at No.1 on the UK Albums Chart.\nKeane are known for using a piano (or a synth) as the lead instrument instead of guitars, differentiating them from most other rock bands. The inclusion of a distorted piano effect in 2006 and various synthesisers were a common feature in their music that back then combined the piano rock sound used during their first album and the more electronic sound which developed on the second and third albums. Since the start of their career, the band has sold over 10 million albums worldwide.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Keith Sweat (born July 22, 1961) is an American R&B/soul, singer-songwriter, record producer, radio personality and an innovator of New Jack Swing.\n\nSweat started his musical career as a member of a Harlem band called \"Jamilah\" in 1975. With the help of Jamilah, Sweat was able to hone his craft as a lead singer by performing regionally throughout the tri-State area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The group was started by bassist Larry Peoples, guitarist Michael Samuels, and drummer Walter Bradley. Additional members of the group included Peter DaCosta (vocals), Joseph McGeachy (sax), Dwight Banks (trumpet), and Kenneth Varner (keyboards).\n\nAfter leaving the group in 1984 to begin a solo career, he sang at nightclubs throughout New York City and landed a chance to record for the independent label, Stadium Records. Sweat recorded only one tune for Stadium called \"My Mind Is Made Up\", which was their third ever release, but on Stadium's first release, he is credited as co-writer and co-producer of \"You Are The One For Me\", the last recording ever made by the group GQ.\n\nLater in 1987, Keith Sweat was discovered by Vincent Davis and offered a recording contract with his label, Vintertainment Records, which was founded in 1983 on the foundations of early Hip-Hop and otherwise best known for releasing Joeski Love's \"Pee Wee Dance\" in 1985. Vintertainment was distributed by Elektra Records from 1985 until it ceased operations in 1990, in which case Elektra opted to buy Keith's contract outright and have him record directly for the label. On November 25, 1987, Sweat released his debut solo studio album Make It Last Forever, which sold three million copies. The biggest hit from this album was the song that inaugurated the New Jack Swing era \"I Want Her\" (#1 R&B/#5 Pop), which was nominated for the 1989 Soul Train Best R&B/Urban Contemporary Song of the Year award, while the title track from the album hit #2 on the R&B charts. Sweat reached the charts again with his second album I'll Give All My Love to You (1990) which hit #6 on the Billboard 200 chart. The singles released during this period included \"(There You Go) Tellin' Me No Again\" (from the film New Jack City). He released his third album, Keep It Comin' in 1991 which debuted in the top 20 of the album chart. This album, included the songs, \"Why Me Baby\" (featuring LL Cool J) and \"Keep It Comin'\". Sweat then moved from New York to Atlanta, where he founded the Keia Records label that would feature Silk & Kut Klose.\n\nSweat released his fourth album Get Up on It in the summer of 1994, and his self-titled fifth album in 1996. Both albums reached the top ten on the Billboard 200. The single co/produced and written by Eric McCaine \"Twisted\" featuring R&B group Kut Klose hit #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and \"Nobody\" hit #3, which made them Sweat's biggest hits to date. The song \"Just A Touch\", with Traci Hale providing background vocals, has earned a regular spot on radio playlists. \"Just A Touch\" was a cover of the 1979 song \"Just a Touch of Love\" by Slave. Sweat's sixth album, Still in the Game was released in 1998, hitting #6 on the Billboard 200, and #2 on the R&B/Hip Hop albums chart. It featured the singles \"Come and Get With Me\" (which featured Snoop Dogg) (#12 Hot 100) and \"I'm Not Ready\" (#16 Hot 100). Sweat's success on the charts started to diminish in 2000, when he released the album Didn't See Me Coming.\n",

Some people have called her \"The Female Rod Stewart\" due to her raspy voice.\nAs a young singer, Kim Carnes joined The New Christy Minstrels in 1966 together with Kenny Rogers and Karen Black. After writing songs for many years, Carnes signed her first publishing deal in 1969 with producer Jimmy Bowen. During this period, she shared demo-recording time with Bowen's other writers, including Don Henley, Glenn Frey, and J.D. Souther. Carnes also sang \"Nobody Knows,\" written by Mike Settle, which was featured in the end credits of the 1971 film, Vanishing Point. The film also featured Carnes' first selection as a songwriter, \"Sing Out for Jesus,\" which was recorded by Willie Mae \"Big Mama\" Thornton.\nIn the early 1970s, Carnes and husband Dave Ellingson co-wrote several songs with David Cassidy, then at the peak of his career as an international idol, and toured the world with him as part of his band. These songs appear on Cassidy's albums Rock Me Baby, Dreams are Nuthin' More than Wishes and Cassidy Live!, where Carnes' backing vocals can be heard to great effect.\nHer first solo album, Rest on Me, produced by Jimmy Bowen, was released in 1972. Her self-titled album in 1975 contained her first charted hit, \"You're a Part Of Me\" (No. 32 AC). This album was followed in 1976 by Sailin', produced by the legendary Jerry Wexler. One selection, \"Love Comes from Unexpected Places\" won Best Composition at the 1977 American Song Festival and gained additional notice after it was recorded by Barbra Streisand on her 1977 album Streisand Superman. Streisand also recorded Carnes' \"Stay Away\" on her 1978 album Songbird. In spite of Streisand's endorsement of her material, Carnes' own Top 40 breakthrough did not occur till 1978, when Gene Cotton recruited her to record a duet version of \"You're a Part of Me,\" which reached No. 36 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1979, she recorded a single using the pseudonym Connie con Carne titled \"She Dances With Meat.\"\nIn 1980, her duet with Kenny Rogers \"Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer\" became a major hit on the Pop (No. 4), Country (No. 3) and AC (No. 2) charts. The song was culled from Rogers' concept album, Gideon, which was written entirely by Carnes and her husband Dave Ellingson. Later that year, her cover version of the Smokey Robinson & The Miracles song \"More Love\" became her first solo Top 10 hit (No. 10 Pop, No. 6 AC).",

        "strBiographyEN" : "King Crimson are a rock band founded in London in 1968 by members from western England. Widely recognised as a foundational progressive rock group, the band have incorporated diverse influences and instrumentation during their history (including jazz and folk music, classical and experimental music, psychedelic rock, hard rock and heavy metal, New Wave, gamelan, electronica and drum and bass). They have been influential on many contemporary musical artists and have gained a large following, despite garnering little radio or music video airplay.\n\nPeter Sinfield, interviewed for Prog Rock Britannia: An Observation in Three Movements, described Crimson thus: \"e had an Ethos in Crimson...we just refused to play anything that sounded anything like a Tin Pan Alley record. If it sounded at all popular, it was out. So it had to be complicated, it had to be more expansive chords, it had to have strange influences. If it sounded, like, too simple, we'd make it more complicated, we'd play it in 7/8 or 5/8, just to show off.\"\n\nThough originating in England, King Crimson have had a mixture of English and American personnel since 1981. The band's line-up has persistently altered throughout their existence, with eighteen musicians and two lyricists passing through the ranks. The only musician to appear in every line-up of the band has been founding guitarist Robert Fripp, although drummer Bill Bruford was a member from 1972 to 1998 and guitarist Adrian Belew has been a consistent member since 1981.\n\nThe debut line-up of the band was influential but short-lived, lasting for just over one year. During 1970 and 1971, King Crimson were an unstable band, with many personnel changes and disjunctions between studio and live sound as they explored elements of jazz, funk and classical chamber music. By 1972 the band had a more stable line-up and developed an improvisational sound mingling hard rock, contemporary classical music, free jazz and jazz fusion before breaking up in 1974. They re-formed with a new line-up in 1981 for three years (this time influenced by new wave and gamelan music) before breaking up again for around a decade. Since reforming for the second time (in 1994), King Crimson have blended aspects of their 1980s and 1970s sound with influences from more recent musical genres such as industrial rock and grunge. The band’s efforts to blend additional elements into their music have continued into the 21st century, with more recent developments including drum and bass-styled rhythm loops and extensive use of MIDI and guitar synthesis.\n\nKing Crimson's existence has been characterised by regular periods of hiatus initiated by Robert Fripp, and their current status is ambiguous. Despite online diary posts from Fripp suggesting that he does not feel a powerful desire to work within the King Crimson context, he and other members continue to work within the context of related \"ProjeKCts\" (an ongoing succession of spin-offs from the main band initiated in 1997, of which the latest example is the song-based \"Jakszyk, Fripp and Collins\"). Fripp told the Financial Times in August 2012 that he has retired from music.",

King's X was ranked No. 83 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.\nSince being signed to Megaforce Records in 1987, King's X has released twelve studio albums, one official live album, and several independent releases. The band's most recent release, XV (album), was released on the InsideOut Music label. Early in their major label career saw the band on several opening slots on arena tours, including opening for AC/DC and the Woodstock '94 festival.\nSince leaving Atlantic records following the release of Ear Candy King's X have released albums through Metal Blade Records, InsideOut Music and independently, and as of January 2014 continue to tour and perform live. Each member of the group has recorded solo albums and has made numerous guest appearances on other artists' albums and compilation projects. Doug Pinnick and Ty Tabor also have albums released with side bands in which they participate.\nThe spiritual nature of the band's lyrics, particularly on their first three albums, has often led to them being labeled a Christian rock band, a label the members have rejected.\n",

Kings of Leon achieved initial success in the United Kingdom with nine Top 40 singles, two BRIT Awards in 2008, and all three of the band's albums at the time peaked in the top five of the UK Albums Chart. Their third album, Because of the Times, also reached the number one spot. After the release of Only by the Night in September 2008 the band achieved chart success in the United States. The singles \"Sex on Fire\", \"Use Somebody\", and \"Notion\" all peaked at number one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart.

        "strBiographyEN" : "An original member of New York's new-school pioneers the Ultramagnetic MC's, \"Kool\" Keith Thornton is best known as a solo rapper. His signature style is stream-of-consciousness lyrical flow and complex vocals, two skills that earn him a perennial nod from the underground hip-hop community. The average Kool Keith album is peppered with bizarre, disjointed, even delusional or disassociated themes, concepts, and references. Nearly all of his albums incorporate a satirical dislike for more commercialized strains of hip-hop, as well as major record labels.  Thornton's early career and lyrics with the Ultramagnetic MC's often referenced his time as a patient of Bellevue, a psychiatric hospital, where he was treated for depression. With Ultramagnetic MC's, his abstract style developed, maturing in songs like Poppa Large. He was probably the first rapper to create an alter ego, and then create an alter ego for that alter ego (Kool Keith v. Moe Luv). After the Ultramagnetic MC's broke up, he expanded his resume, experimenting with new styles, including his self-described pornocore, known for pornographic imagery and brutal, abstract lyrics. Sex Style released in 1997, was the showcase for this genre.  Teaming up with Dan the Automator Nakamura under the name Dr. Octagon, Thornton again reinvented his image, recording the self-titled Dr. Octagon album (later reissued under the title Dr. Octagonecologyst) which was released by the English trip hop label Mo Wax. The album received critical acclaim, though mainly from sources outside the mainstream hip-hop community. The critical success of the album helped to open the accessibility of the underground hip hop scene to an appreciative audience. For Dan the Automator, this album laid the foundation for a burgeoning career and accolades as a producer; for Thornton, the success of Dr. Octagonecologyst seemed to put him in danger of being typecast as a \"space and Mars\" rapper, or an industry tool, which he throughout his career has looked down upon.  His style as a whole is characterized by non sequiturs and bizarre commentary, particularly anal, fecal and genital references. For example, \"Chief administrator suck my oil,\" \"Dr. Ludicrous I turn into an octopus,\" \"All this jealousy shit is mayonnaise and celery shit,\" \"Two drinks minimum, don't worry, we're maximum,\" etc. An instrumental version of the album, Instrumentalyst, showcased the production, became a rising success with most of the credit given to Dan the Automator and other collaborators, even though Thornton is credited on the LP with some production duties.  List of projects, groups and alter-egos:  - Ultramagnetic MC's - Dr. Octagon - Dr. Dooom - Sinister 6000 (Dan the Automator) - Black Elvis - Masters Of Illusion - Analog Brothers - Mr. Nogatco - Project Polaroid - Tashan Dorset - sex style - Ultra - Cenobites - Mr. Nogatco - Sergei Khmelev     (this list is incomplete)",

He is from Manhattan, New York City.  In high school in the late 1970s, he met Special K and DJ Easy Lee. They formed the influential old school hip hop group The Treacherous Three. It is with The Treacherous Three that Kool Moe Dee performed his freestyle, on stage roast of old school party rapper Busy Bee Starski, a performance frequently cited as a pivotal moment in the development of the battle rap. In 1986, Kool Moe Dee went solo, releasing a self-titled album.  He is also well-known for his long-running feud with LL Cool J; he claims that LL Cool J stole his rapping style. The cover of Kool Moe Dee's 1987 album How Ya Like Me Now features a red Kangol hat (LL Cool J's trademark) being crushed under the wheel of a Jeep.  His song I Go To Work from the album Knowledge Is King is considered by some the pinnacle of his work, with high speed, high energy and intricate lyrics masterfully mixed in to the stacatto sounds of a marching band.  Kool Moe Dee also appeared on Will Smith's #1 pop hit \"Wild Wild West\" from Smith's 1999 motion picture, on which he re-performs the chorus to his 1987 single of the same name.  In 2003 he authored a book called \"There's a God on the Mic\" (ISBN 1560255331). The book breaks down his 50 favorite MCs in terms of originality, concepts, versatility, vocabulary, substance, flow, flavor, freestyle, vocal presence, live performance, poetic value, body of work, industry impact, social impact, longevity, lyrics and battle skills.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Kylie Ann Minogue, OBE often known simply as Kylie is an Australian singer, recording artist, songwriter, showgirl, and actress.\nAfter beginning her career as a child actress on Australian television, she achieved recognition through her role in the television soap opera Neighbours, before commencing her career as a recording artist in 1987. Her first single, \"Locomotion\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles chart and became the highest-selling single of the decade. This led to a contract with songwriters and producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. Her debut album, Kylie (1988), and the single \"I Should Be So Lucky\", each reached number one in the UK, and over the next two years, her first 13 singles reached the British top ten.\nInitially presented as a \"girl next door\", Minogue attempted to convey a more mature style in her music and public image. Her singles were well received, but after four albums her sales were declining, and she left Stock, Aitken & Waterman in 1992 to establish herself as an independent performer. Her next single, \"Confide in Me\", reached number one in Australia and was a hit in several European countries in 1994, and a duet with Nick Cave, \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\", brought Minogue a greater degree of artistic credibility. Drawing inspiration from a range of musical styles and artists, Minogue took creative control over the songwriting for her next album, Impossible Princess (1997).\nMinogue returned to prominence in 2000 with the single \"Spinning Around\" and the dance-oriented album Light Years, and she performed during the closing ceremonies of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Her music videos showed a more sexually provocative and flirtatious personality and several hit singles followed. \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" reached number one in more than 40 countries, and the album Fever (2001) was a hit in many countries, including the U.S., a market in which Minogue had previously received little recognition. Minogue embarked on a concert tour but cancelled it when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2005. After treatment, she resumed her career in 2006 with Showgirl Homecoming. In 2009 she embarked upon her For You, For Me tour, her first concert tour of the U.S. and Canada.\nMinogue has achieved worldwide record sales of more than 68 million, and has received notable music awards, including multiple ARIA and Brit Awards and a Grammy Award. She has mounted several successful and critically acclaimed concert world tours and received a Mo Award for \"Australian Entertainer of the Year\" for her live performances. Bestowed from the Queen of Australia Queen Elizabeth II, she was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (O.B.E.) at Buckingham Palace in 2008 \"for services to music\". In the same year she was awarded France's highest cultural honour, the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French government for her contribution to the enrichment of French culture. In 2011 \"I Should Be So Lucky\" was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia's Sounds of Australia registry. While also in 2011, Minogue was awarded an honorary Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.) degree by Anglia Ruskin University in the United Kingdom of for her work in raising awareness for breast cancer. On 27 November 2011 on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the ARIA Music Awards, Kylie Minogue was inducted by the Australian Recording Industry Association into the ARIA Hall of Fame.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "L7 was formed by René Lucas on bass guitar, Donita Sparks and Suzi Gardner on shared electric guitar and shared vocals in 1985. A year prior, Gardner had performed backing vocals on the Black Flag song \"Slip It In\". The punk rock duo were soon joined by Jennifer Finch on bass guitar, replacing René Lucas who left the band to raise a family, and Roy Koutsky on drums. Koutsky left shortly after and Demetra \"Dee\" Plakas became their permanent drummer.\nThe band's name derives from a 1950s slang phrase meaning \"square\", but is often mistaken for a reference to the sex position, \"69\". The slang phrase \"L7\" can be heard in the Sam the Sham & the Pharaohs song \"Wooly Bully\" (\"Let's not be L7, come and learn to dance...\"), in the Rick James song \"Bustin' Out\" (\"L7- just a little too damn straight...\"), and in the Paul McCartney song \"C Moon\" (\"I could be L7 and I'll never get to heaven if I fill my head with glue\").\nIn 1991, the band formed Rock for Choice, a Pro-Choice women's rights group which was supported by other prominent bands of that era, including Pearl Jam, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana, and Rage Against the Machine.\nTheir 1992 third album Bricks Are Heavy, produced by Butch Vig, was featured in Rolling Stone's May 1999 list of 'Essential recordings of the 1990s', and was their most successful release.\nL7's fourth album, Hungry for Stink, was released in July 1994 and coincided with their Lollapalooza tour, in which they shared the stage with many of the era's most successful acts such as The Smashing Pumpkins and The Breeders.\nFinch left the band during the recording of their next album, with Sparks and Greta Brinkman playing bass on their fifth album The Beauty Process: Triple Platinum, after which Gail Greenwood, (formerly of the band Belly) became the band's full-time bassist.\nThe band's most recent album, Slap-Happy, was released in 1999 and did not chart on either side of the Atlantic. To promote the record, on July 17, 1999, a plane flew over the crowd at the Lilith Fair at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, with a banner that read, \"Bored? Tired? Try L7.\" The following day, a second airplane flew over the crowd at the Warped Tour at the Stone Pony lot in Asbury Park, New Jersey. This banner declared, \"Warped needs more beaver...love, L7.\"  Greenwood later left the band and was replaced by Janis Tanaka, formerly of the San Francisco band, Stone Fox. Tanaka would later go on to play bass for the singer Pink, while Greenwood would later play with the singer Bif Naked.\nHowever, by 2001 the band was no longer touring. According to the band's website, \"L7 are on an indefinite hiatus. We know that's vague, but that's just the way it is. The future of the band is a bit up in the air at the moment.\" L7 appears to be defunct for all practical purposes, as Sparks is currently pursuing her own solo career, along with Plakas, and two other guitarists, in the band Donita Sparks and The Stellar Moments. Finch is working in a punk rock group, The Shocker. During this time, Donita Sparks was working on a documentary about the band, with a rumoured 2014 release date.\n\nOn December 10, 2014, L7 announced, on their official Facebook page, that they would be reuniting, featuring Donita Sparks, Suzi Gardner, Jennifer Finch and Demetra Plakas. As part of the reunion, the band revamped their website and included a mailing list for fans.\n\nA documentary is being made about the band and was being funded through Kickstarter.",

He is known for romantic ballads such as \"I Need Love\", \"Around the Way Girl\" and \"Hey Lover\" as well as pioneering hip-hop such as \"I Can't Live Without My Radio\", \"I'm Bad\", \"The Boomin' System\", and \"Mama Said Knock You Out\". He has released thirteen studio albums and two greatest hits compilations, including 2008's Exit 13, the last for his record deal with Def Jam Recordings, and currently has a new studio album in the works. He has also appeared in numerous films, and currently stars as NCIS Special Agent Sam Hanna on the CBS crime drama television series NCIS: Los Angeles.\nAs he grew older, Smith found a way to escape the effects of his abuse, and his bullying attitude: hip-hop music. He fell in love with it at the age of nine, and by 11 he was writing lyrics and making his own songs with some DJ equipment his grandmother gave him to stop him riding motorcycles or doing karate. Before too long, LL was an established member of the Hip-Hop community in his area. He gained notoriety through his many rap battles against well-established MC.\n\nInfluenced by Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, funk legend Rick James, Kurtis Blow, and pioneers Run-DMC, LL started to create his own rap style.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Lamb of God is an American heavy metal band from Richmond, Virginia. Formed in 1990, the group consists of vocalist Randy Blythe, guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler, bassist John Campbell, and drummer Chris Adler. The band is considered to be a part of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal movement.\nSince its formation, Lamb of God has released six studio albums, one live album, one compilation album and three DVDs. The band's cumulative sales equal almost two million in the United States. In 2007 the band received a Grammy nomination for their 2006 album Sacrament. Lamb of God has toured with the Ozzfest twice and appeared on Slayer's The Unholy Alliance Tour in 2006. They have also played at many other major festivals around the world including Download Festival and Sonisphere Festival in the UK, Soundwave Festival, and Gigantour (headlined by Megadeth). Recently, (2008-2010) they have toured with Metallica (World Magnetic Tour). Lamb of God also played on the main stage on Mayhem Festival 2010.\nIn 1990, guitarist Mark Morton, drummer Chris Adler, bassist John Campbell and Matt Conner started a band named Burn the Priest as a 4 piece with no singer. The band members knew each other from the college they were all attending, Virginia Commonwealth University, in Richmond, Virginia. Morton left the band soon after its inception to receive his master's degree, and Matt Conner left the band to work on another one. Adler and Campbell replaced Morton with Abe Spear. For the next five years, the band practiced in Richmond and around Virginia. In 1995, the band released its self-titled first demo. After the demo, Burn the Priest recorded two split albums with Agents of Satan and ZED respectively. After the band's first three demos, Burn the Priest added vocalist Randall Blythe to its line up.\nIn 1997, Morton returned to the band. Two years later, the band released its first full-length self-titled album, Burn the Priest, through Legion Records. Mikey Bronsnan of Legion Records saved up $2,500 for the recording and then broke them in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania through DIY shows. The album was produced by Today Is the Day guitarist and vocalist Steve Austin. Spear left the band, leaving an open position for a guitarist. Willie Adler, became the band's second guitarist a year later, and a deal with Prosthetic Records was signed. Contrary to rumours being spread, the band did not change their name to Lamb of God because of being banned from certain venues, as this banning occurred after they changed their name to Lamb of God. They changed their name because people thought they were a satanic metal band and because their line-up changed.",

She is best known for being a member of the Fugees and for her solo album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.\nRaised in East Orange, New Jersey, Hill began singing with her music-oriented family during her childhood. She enjoyed success as an actress at an early age, appearing in a recurring role on the television soap opera As the World Turns and starring in the film Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. In high school, Hill was approached by Pras Michel to start a band, which his cousin, Wyclef Jean, soon joined. They renamed themselves the Fugees and released two studio albums, Blunted on Reality (1994) and the Grammy Award-winning The Score (1996), which sold six million copies in the United States. In the latter record, Hill rose to prominence with her African-American and Caribbean music influences, her rapping and singing, and a rendition of the hit \"Killing Me Softly\". Hill's tumultuous romantic relationship with Jean led to the split of the band in 1997, after which she began to focus on solo projects.\nThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998) remains Hill's only solo studio album. It received massive critical acclaim, showcasing a representation of life and relationships and locating a contemporary womanist voice within the neo soul genre. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and has sold approximately eight million copies there. It included the singles \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" (also a number one), \"Ex-Factor\", and \"Everything Is Everything\". Among numerous others, at the 41st Grammy Awards, the record earned her five awards, including Album of the Year and Best New Artist.\nSoon afterward, Hill dropped out of the public eye, dissatisfied with the music industry and suffering with the pressures of fame. Her last full-length recording, the new-material live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 (2002), sharply divided critics and sold poorly compared to her debut. Hill's subsequent activity, which includes the release of a few songs and occasional festival appearances, has been sporadic and erratic. It has sometimes caused audience dissatisfaction; a reunion with her former group did not last long. Her music, as well as a series of public statements she has issued, have become critical of pop culture and societal institutions. Hill has six children, five of whom are with Rohan Marley, son of reggae legend Bob Marley.",

Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential rock groups in the history of music.\nAfter changing their name, the band signed a favourable deal with Atlantic Records that allowed them considerable artistic freedom. Led Zeppelin disliked the releasing of tracks as singles, preferring their albums to be viewed as indivisible, whole listening experiences, helping to promote the concept of album-orientated rock. Their first two albums, with their heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound, led to Led Zeppelin being regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock, even though the band's individualistic style drew from varied sources and transcends any single music genre. Their next two albums incorporated wider musical influences, particularly from folk music; the fourth, untitled album, which featured the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it cemented the status of the group as \"superstars\". Subsequent albums saw greater musical experimentation and were accompanied by record-breaking tours, which, like the group's previous tours, earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties and circumstances of the members. Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's sudden death in 1980.",

Two singles were released: \"You Weren't There\" and \"Another Day\". \"You Weren't There\" debuted at No. 1 on Norway Singles Top 20 and remained on the chart for 11 weeks. It also stayed for 24 weeks in Italy Singles Top 50 chart, peaking at No. 1. \"You Weren't There\" was less successful in the UK, reaching #59. The single Another Day was released in Italy and Norway only, and peaked at No. 17 on the Italian Singles chart. \"Sorry\" was released only in Italy.\n\nLost in a Moment (2005–2007)\nIn June 2005, Lene released her third album, Lost in a Moment. The first single from that album, \"How Would It Be,\" was released in Europe in May 2005, and made the Top 20 in both Norway and Italy Singles chart. This single also appeared briefly for a week at a low spot in Germany Singles Top 100. The second single was \"What If\", released only in Italy.\n\nDespite being less well known in other parts of the world, Marlin made a trip to Taiwan and China during October 2005 to promote a Taiwanese version of Lost in a Moment. This included one bonus track, \"Still Here\", a cover of a song by a famous Chinese singer, Faye Wong. The visit proved to be successful; events held included a concert appearance hosted by MTV Taiwan, various television appearances, and a live street gig. Her record company claims that Lost in a Moment was their best selling western record of the year.\n\nTwist the Truth (2008–present):\nIn July 2008 the Norwegian press announced that she was in studio recording her fourth album with the Norwegian artists and songwriters Even \"Magnet\" Johansen and Børge Fjordheim at Askøy, Grand Sports and Malabar Studios. \"Twist The Truth\", her fourth album, was released on 30 March 2009. Unlike her previous three albums, the basic sound focuses strongly on an \"unplugged\" feel in the song performances, close to what a \"live in studio\" concert would be.\n\nThe album has 10 tracks. The first single, \"Here We Are\", was number one on the Norwegian National Radio Chart for two weeks, and was the most airplayed Norwegian song of 2009.\nWork with other artists\n\nLene Marlin has written / co-written songs for other artists, including Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad.\n\nIn 2006, she performed with Swiss band, Lovebugs on their single \"Avalon\", which made the Top 10 in the Swiss chart as well as topping the Swiss National Airplay Chart.\n\nIn 2009, Marlin was featured on Aleksander Denstad With's single \"Worth It\" which peaked at #3 on Norway Single Chart and earned a Gold Record for single sales in Norway.\n\nOn October 4, 2010, Elin Gaustad's album \"Whole New Beginning\" was released, featuring two new Lene songs, the title track and \"Picking Up The Pieces\".\n\nIn 2011 she worked with Gary Louris, Autumn Rowe, Mads Langer, and Tobias Stenkjaer.\n\nOn April 27, 2012, September Blue, Frida Amundsen's debut album was released. One of the tracks, Yesterday's gone was cowritten by Lene Marlin.\n\nLene Marlin took part in the reality show, Each time we meet, which will be broadcast in 2013.\n\nMarlin has won four awards: Best Pop Solo Artist, Best Single (\"Sitting Down Here\"), Best Newcomer and the Artist Of The Year at the Norwegian equivalent to the Grammy awards 1999 (Spelleman), as well as the MTV Europe award for Best Nordic Act, presented in Dublin, Ireland in November 1999. Marlin was also nominated for Best International Breakthrough Act at the 2001 BRIT Awards, alongside P!nk, Jill Scott and Westlife, with the award going to Kelis.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Lifehouse is an American rock band from Los Angeles comprising Jason Wade (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Rick Woolstenhulme, Jr. (drums, percussion), Bryce Soderberg (bass guitar, back-up vocals) and Ben Carey (lead guitar).\n\nThe band came to mainstream prominence in 2001 with the hit single \"Hanging by a Moment\" from their debut studio album, No Name Face. The song peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, and the single won a Billboard Music Award for Hot 100 Single of the Year, having spent twenty weeks in the top 10 and more than a year on the charts.\n\nIn 2002, Lifehouse released their follow-up album Stanley Climbfall. Since then, they have released four more albums: the eponymous Lifehouse in 2005, Who We Are in 2007, Smoke and Mirrors in 2010, and Almería in 2012. These albums have spawned the singles \"You and Me\", \"First Time\", and \"Whatever It Takes\", which have all been top 40 hits in the US.\nTo date, Lifehouse has sold over 15 million singles and albums worldwide, approximately 5 million of which are albums.\n\n1996–2000: Blyss and formation of Lifehouse\nJason Wade had been writing songs since his parents' divorce as a coping mechanism. After moving to Los Angeles in 1995, he met bassist Sergio Andrade, his next-door neighbor. The following year, Wade, Andrade, and Jon \"Diff\" Palmer formed \"Blyss\", the forerunner of Lifehouse, and began to play live shows at high schools and colleges. Later, Collin Hayden and Aaron Lord were added to the band.\nSoon thereafter, word-of-mouth reached producer Ron Aniello, who introduced the band to Jude Cole, who in turn introduced them to DreamWorks Records principal Michael Ostin. In 1998, Anniello produced Blyss's first demos, with the financial backing of DreamWorks Records. Some of these recordings would form the 1999 EP Diff's Lucky Day, which would be sold at live concerts or distributed among friends and music industry contacts.\nIn 2000, Blyss changed its name to \"Lifehouse\". On their choosing the band name, frontman Jason Wade said, \"It's about what we do as a band and for me personally. Most of this record is about my life and about life's circumstances. Not only my life, but other peoples' lives. We thought Lifehouse was a good name for it.\"\n\n2000: No Name Face\nIn 2000, Lifehouse re-recorded, remixed, and released twelve of the fifteen Diff's Lucky Day session demos as No Name Face, their debut major label release.\nNo Name Face met significant commercial success and established the band, and eventually would sell in excess of 4 million copies worldwide. This was in part due to the success of \"Hanging by a Moment\", Lifehouse's first commercial single. Due to the charisma and talent of frontman Wade, DreamWork Record's focus was primarily on him. \"Hanging by a Moment\" was the third song in chart history to be named the \"No. 1 Song of the Year\" on the Billboard Hot 100 despite not having reached No. 1 on any weekly Billboard Hot 100 survey (after Sam the Sham & The Pharaohs' \"Wooly Bully\" in 1965 and Faith Hill's \"Breathe\" in 2000). The second single from the album, \"Sick Cycle Carousel\", was not as commercially successful as \"Hanging by a Moment\", but peaked at No. 35 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart, and the third and final single was \"Breathing\", a reworking of a song that was featured on Diff's Lucky Day.\nThe song \"Everything\" was the first of many Lifehouse songs to be featured in the future hit WB drama Smallville. Seven of the band's songs would be featured in episodes of the series' first four seasons, and the band itself would perform live at the Smallville prom at the end of the fourth-season episode \"Spirit\". The song, \"You and Me,\" would be released on the series' second soundtrack, Smallville: The Metropolis Mix, in an extended form, subtitled the \"Wedding Version\" (\"You and Me (Wedding Version)\"). The song \"Everything\" was also used in the series' 200th episode, \"Homecoming\", in the show's 10th and final season, as an homage to the series pilot and first-season finale episodes.\nThe song \"Somewhere in Between,\" also from No Name Face, was featured in the first-season episode of Falcon Beach, \"The Blame Game\".\nBy the release date of Lifehouse's début album, October 31, 2000, Palmer had left the band, and Wade and Andrade were the only remaining founding members. Soon after recording No Name Face, Wade and Andrade met Rick Woolstenhulme, who auditioned for the needed drummer part and joined the band as full-time drummer. Before the audition, Woolstenhulme had been rehearsing in an adjacent room to Lifehouse and frequently he and Wade would pass each other without meeting the other.\n\n2002–05: Stanley Climbfall\nShortly after a long tour for No Name Face, Lifehouse reentered the studio to cut their second album, Stanley Climbfall. The album's initial success was short-lived and its singles, \"Spin\" and \"Take Me Away\", were vastly overshadowed by the success of the first album. Shortly after the album debuted, Rick's brother Sean Woolstenhulme (of The Calling) officially became the fourth member of the band in June 2002. He had previously toured with Lifehouse.\nIn April 2004, Sergio Andrade confirmed that he had decided to leave the band to pursue individual projects. Shortly after his departure, Sean also left the band to pursue other musical projects such as Abandoned Pools and The Jimmy Chamberlin Complex.\n\n2005–07: Lifehouse\nJason Wade and Rick Woolstenhulme remained the active members of Lifehouse. In late 2004, Bryce Soderberg (previously of AM Radio) signed on as Lifehouse's new bassist. On July 6, 2004, they went to Maryland to begin work on their eponymous third album. Lifehouse was released on March 22, 2005 and was produced by John Alagia.\nThe album's first single, \"You and Me\", was released for airplay on January 18, 2005. It was written several years prior and was originally performed by Jason Wade in the 2000 independent film All Over Again. The song was a success and stayed on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 for 62 weeks (the fifth longest-charted in history), peaking at No. 5. The song also appears on the soundtrack to Smallville. One episode, \"Spirit\", featured the band actually performing it and three other songs from the album (\"Come Back Down\", \"Blind\", and \"Undone\") on the show. The song has also appeared on Cold Case, Boston Legal, Gavin & Stacey, Everwood, Grey's Anatomy, The 4400 and Medium. The song \"All In All\" was featured in Scrubs.\nThe music video for the album's second single, \"Blind\", was released October 19, 2005. It stars Tina Majorino and features several other up-and-coming young actors such as Sarch McClain, Stephen Cheung, Christopher Thien Duc Van and Andy Walters.\nIn 2006, the song 'Good Enough' was featured in the Disney film 'The Wild' and was repeated over the end credits.\n\n2007–09: Who We Are\nTheir fourth album, entitled Who We Are, was released on June 19, 2007. The album features Wade, Woolstenhulme and Soderberg as its lineup, and \"rocks a little harder\" than their previous album, according to the band. The album was recorded in Kiefer Sutherland and Jude Cole's recording studio, Ironworks Studios, in Los Angeles. The album's release was followed by a tour with The Goo Goo Dolls and Colbie Caillat, which began June 15 at the Dodge Theatre in Phoenix, AZ, after which the band embarked on a \"worldwide headlining tour\".\nThe album's first single was \"First Time\", released on April 24, 2007. The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 48 in May, and peaked at No. 3 on the Hot Adult Top 40 Charts.\nThe album's second single, \"Whatever It Takes\", was released to radio stations on October 29, 2007. The song's music video premiered on Yahoo Music on November 16, 2007.\n\"Broken\", the album's third single, has appeared on several TV series, including Grey's Anatomy (\"Lay Your Hands On Me\"), Criminal Minds (\"In Birth and Death,\" season 3, episode 2), One Tree Hill, One Life To Live and The Hills. Most recently, it was featured in the motion picture soundtrack The Time Traveler's Wife. So far, it has peaked at No. 83 on the Billboard Hot 100. The music video for \"Broken\" officially debuted on VH1's Top 20 Countdown on September 20, 2008.\nThe song \"Who We Are\" was used in an advertisement on A&E to promote their original programming.\nLifehouse held a contest to make a video for the song \"Make Me Over\". The band gave 60 USC School of Cinematic Arts graduate students a chance to shoot the video for their new single. The winning video premiered at a gala event on December 5, 2008 at the Paley Center for Media in Beverly Hills, CA.\nAs of October 2008, the album had been certified gold.\nOn April 11, 2009, the band announced that Ben Carey was an official member of the band. They said that they had been \"a four piece for some time\" and that Ben is \"family to us\". Ben had been touring with the band since 2004.\n\n2009–2010: Smoke & Mirrors\nLifehouse announced in August 2008 that they would be starting on their fifth album, which was tentatively scheduled for a late 2009 release. The band entered the studio on November 12, 2008 to begin working on the project. They stated in an interview at ESPN Magazine's NEXT Party during Super Bowl XLIII that the album should be released in late 2009. Lifehouse revealed during their 2009 tour that the album would also include the band's previously released single \"From Where You Are.\" It was announced on October 15 that the new album would be called Smoke & Mirrors and would be released on December 8, 2009. However, on November 13, 2009, the band stated on its web page that it would now be released on February 2, 2010. The first single was \"Halfway Gone,\" which was released on October 27, 2009. The music video premiered on the VH1 Top 20 on VH1.com at the end of November. The album was released in a standard, deluxe, and two-disc deluxe edition. On December 22, Tommy2.net reported that the album had been pushed back once again, this time to February 23, 2010. The album was then delayed again, but was released on March 2, 2010.\nThe album debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 with 54,203 sold. This marked the highest chart debut of their ten year career, beating out first week chart position for their 2002 sophomore set Stanley Climbfall, which debuted at No. 7.\n\n2011–present: Almería\nIn August 2011, Lifehouse announced on their official Facebook page that they were working on their sixth studio album.\nThe first single from their new album was released on September 11, 2012 and is called \"Between the Raindrops.\" The song features Natasha Bedingfield.\nOn October 18, 2012, the band announced that the title of their sixth album is \"Almería\". It was released on December 11 in the US, and December 12 worldwide.",

As a teenager, Kim would rap for fun, being heavily influenced by other female MC'S like MC Lyte and Lady of Rage. When word got to The Notorious B.I.G. that she could rhyme, he made Jones perform a freestyle for him on the spot. Impressed with her, he took her in and she began her music career in 1995 with the group Junior M.A.F.I.A., whose debut album Conspiracy generated three hit singles. In late 1996, her solo debut album Hard Core was released. Hard Core was certified double platinum and spawned three consecutive #1 rap hits that included: \"No Time\" \"Not Tonight (Ladies Night remix)\" and \"Crush on You\", a record for a female rapper. Her following albums, The Notorious K.I.M. (2000) and La Bella Mafia (2003), both were certified platinum by the RIAA, making Kim the only female rapper besides Missy Elliott to have at least 3 platinum albums so far. Kim solidified her star power in 2001, when \"Lady Marmalade\", a song Kim was featured on, went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. That made her the second female rapper to earn a #1 on that chart.\nIn 2005, she served a year long prison sentence for lying to a jury about her friends' involvement in a shooting four years earlier. During her incarceration, her fourth album The Naked Truth was released. Lil' Kim returned to the public spotlight in 2009 with an appearance on Dancing with the Stars.",

Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart.\nHaving adapted the nu metal and rap metal genres to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres in their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight, which was released in 2007. The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year. The band has collaborated with several other artists, most notably with rapper Jay-Z in their mashup EP Collision Course, and many others included on Reanimation. The band's most recent work, Living Things, was released on June 26, 2012. Linkin Park has sold over 50 million albums worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards.\nThe founding of Linkin Park began with three high school friends; Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson. After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave \"Phoenix\" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda’s makeshift bedroom studio in 1996. Tensions and frustration within the band grew after they failed to land a record deal. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band's vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects. Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax and other bands.\nAfter spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Arizona vocalist, Chester Bennington, who was recommended by Jeff Blue, the vice president of Zomba Music in March 1999. Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge band by the name of Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style. The band then agreed on changing its name from Xero to Hybrid Theory. The newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material. The band’s renaissance culminated with a change in name; from Hybrid Theory, the band once again changed its name, this time to Linkin Park, a play on and homage to Santa Monica’s Lincoln Park. However, despite these changes, the band still struggled to sign a record deal. After facing numerous rejections from several major record labels, Linkin Park turned to Jeff Blue for additional help. After failing to catch Warner Bros. Records on three previous reviews, Jeff Blue, now the vice president of Warner Bros. Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company in 1999. The band released its breakthrough album, Hybrid Theory, the following year.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Lionel Brockman Richie, Jr. (born June 20, 1949) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, record producer and actor. From 1968, he was a member of the musical group Commodores signed to Motown Records. Richie made his solo debut in 1982 with the album Lionel Richie and number-one hit \"Truly\".\n\nRichie was born in Tuskegee, Alabama, the son of Alberta R. (Foster) and Lionel Brockman Richie. Richie grew up on the campus of Tuskegee Institute. His grandfather's house was across the street from the home of the president of the college. His family moved to Joliet, Illinois, where he graduated from Joliet Township High School, East Campus. A star tennis player in Joliet, he accepted a tennis scholarship to attend Tuskegee Institute, and graduated with a major in economics. After receiving his undergraduate degree from Tuskegee, Richie briefly attended graduate school at Auburn University. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi and Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity.\n\nAs a student in Tuskegee, Richie formed a succession of R&B groups in the mid-1960s. In 1968 he became a singer and saxophonist with the Commodores. They signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 1968 for one record before moving on to Motown Records initially as a support act to The Jackson 5. The Commodores then became established as a popular soul group. Their first several albums had a danceable, funky sound, as in such tracks as \"Machine Gun\" and \"Brick House.\" Over time, Richie wrote and sang more romantic, easy-listening ballads such as \"Easy\", \"Three Times a Lady\", \"Still\", and the tragic breakup ballad \"Sail On\".\n\nBy the late 1970s he had begun to accept songwriting commissions from other artists. He composed \"Lady\" for Kenny Rogers, which hit #1 in 1980, and produced Rogers's album Share Your Love the following year. Richie and Rogers maintained a strong friendship in later years. Latin jazz composer and salsa romantica pioneer La Palabra enjoyed international success with his cover of \"Lady,\" which was played at Latin dance clubs. Also in 1981 Richie sang the theme song for the film Endless Love, a duet with Diana Ross. Issued as a single, the song topped the UK, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and US pop music charts, and became one of Motown's biggest hits (in the US it sold 2 million copies and became a platinum single record). Its success encouraged Richie to branch out into a full-fledged solo career in 1982. He was replaced as lead singer for The Commodores by Skyler Jett in 1983. His debut album, Lionel Richie, produced another chart-topping single, \"Truly\", which continued the style of his ballads with the Commodores.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Carmelita Rossana \"Lita\" Ford (born 19 September 1958) is a British-born, American-raised rock guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter, who was the lead guitarist for The Runaways in the late 1970s before embarking on a successful solo career in the 1980s\n\nIn 1975, at the age of 16, Ford was recruited by recording impresario Kim Fowley to join the all-female rock band he was assembling called The Runaways. The band soon secured a recording contract and released their first album in 1976. The band's \"jailbait on the run\" gimmick garnered significant media attention and The Runaways became a successful recording and touring act during their late 1970s heyday. Ford's lead-guitar playing became an integral element of the band's sound until their eventual break-up in 1979.\n\nIn 1979, internal conflicts were erupting within The Runaways, who had by that time already parted ways with producer Fowley, lead singer Cherie Currie, and bassist Jackie Fox. Vocalist/guitarist Joan Jett wanted the band to shift to a more Ramones-influenced punk rock sound, while Ford and drummer Sandy West wanted to continue playing the hard rock-oriented songs the band had become known for. With neither faction willing to compromise, the band finally broke up in late 1979.\n\nFollowing the breakup of The Runaways, Ford set about launching a solo career. Her debut solo album, entitled Out for Blood, was released in 1983 and was a commercial disappointment. Her next release, 1984's Dancin' on the Edge achieved moderate success and Ford's popularity began to rise, due largely to her sex appeal with the largely male heavy metal audience. Dancin' on the Edge included the single \"Fire In My Heart\", which reached the Top 10 in several countries outside the US. The follow-up single, \"Gotta Let Go\", was a bonafide hit for Ford, reaching Number One on the Mainstream Rock charts.\n\nFord toured extensively for the next four years while not releasing any new music. A follow-up to Dancin' On The Edge, entitled The Bride Wore Black, was recorded with Tony Iommi serving as producer, but never released. Ford claims this was because the new Mercury Records president \"was a country fan and he didn't have a clue as what to do with me\". The status of those recordings remains unclear; Ford has alternately stated that the unfinished album remains \"sitting in my closet\" and may still be released one day or is \"in (record) label hell! Who knows what shelf that is sitting on!\"\n\nFollowing the failure to have her third solo album released, Ford signed with RCA Records, hired Sharon Osbourne Management, and re-emerged with a more radio-friendly pop-metal sound. In 1988 she released her most commercially successful album, the self-produced Lita. The album featured four commercial hits, including \"Kiss Me Deadly\", \"Back To The Cave\", \"Close My Eyes Forever\", and \"Falling In And Out Of Love\", a song co-written by Nikki Sixx of Mötley CrÃ¼e. The ballad \"Close My Eyes Forever\", a duet with Sharon's husband Ozzy Osbourne, remains her most successful song, reaching #8 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nFord followed up the success of Lita with the 1990 album Stiletto. Stiletto featured the singles \"Hungry\" and \"Lisa\" (a song dedicated to her mother). However, the album failed to match the success of her previous release. Ford's next release was 1991's Dangerous Curves on Spitfire Records, which featured her last charting single to date, \"Shot Of Poison\". Ford's final album prior to a lengthy recording hiatus was Black on the German ZYX label.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Ford placed a reduced priority on her music career as she turned her attention towards raising her two young sons. Following the release of Black in 1995, Ford did not release new material until the Wicked Wonderland album almost fifteen years later.\n\nIn June of 2008, Ford re-emerged with a new band, playing several warm-up gigs under the moniker Kiss Me Deadly prior to Rocklahoma in the New York City area. In June of 2009, she began touring the United States and Europe with a new line-up consisting of current Guns N' Roses guitarist Ron 'Bumblefoot' Thal, Bumblefoot drummer Dennis Leeflang, and Deepfield bassist PJ Farley.\n\nAfter a long recording hiatus, Ford released the new album Wicked Wonderland on October 6th, 2009, on the small JLRG Entertainment label. In an interview with ExclusiveMagazine.com, Ford spoke about her new material: \"I just wanted to kick ass! I don't know what's popular, or the flavor of the day. I just wanted the music to rock! The lyrics are very personal and that's it. I wasn't going to come out in sandals with hairy armpits!\".\n\nIn May 2011, Ford promised to release a \"real comeback album\" later in the year, saying that 2009's nu metal-inspired Wicked Wonderland, was too much of a collective project with ex-husband Jim Gillette. \"A lot of people have told me that they want a real Lita Ford album, and I know what they mean. They are going to get it,\" she was quoted as saying at the time. The album Living Like A Runaway was released in June of 2012 on on SPV/Steamhammer Records. True to her word, the album was much more in line with her earlier work. The title is also celebratory, as Ford recently buried the hatchet with her former Runaways' bandmates.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Richard Wayne Penniman (born December 5, 1932; † 9. Mai 2020 in Tullahoma, Tennessee), known by the stage name Little Richard, was an American singer, songwriter, musician, recording artist, and actor, considered key in the transition from rhythm and blues to rock and roll in the mid-1950s. He was also the first artist to put the funk in the rock and roll beat and contributed significantly to the early development of soul music. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website entry on Penniman states that:\nHe claims to be \"the architect of rock and roll\", and history would seem to bear out Little Richard’s boast. More than any other performer - save, perhaps, Elvis Presley, Little Richard blew the lid off the Fifties, laying the foundation for rock and roll with his explosive music and charismatic persona. On record, he made spine-tingling rock and roll. His frantically charged piano playing and raspy, shouted vocals on such classics as \"Tutti Frutti\", \"Long Tall Sally\" and \"Good Golly, Miss Molly\" defined the dynamic sound of rock and roll.\nPenniman began performing on stage and on the road in 1945, when he was in his early teens. He began his recording career on October 16, 1951 by imitating the gospel-influenced style of late-1940s jump blues artist Billy Wright, who was a friend and also helped arrange his first sessions. He recorded for RCA Records from 1951-52 and for Peacock Records beginning in 1953. Dissatisfied with his lack of commercial success during this time, Penniman formed a new \"hard-driving\" R&B road band in 1953. By early 1955, a demo tape of his music caught the attention of Specialty Records president Art Rupe, who bought out his contract from Peacock and arranged for him to record for Specialty in September 1955. Under the guidance of Robert \"Bumps\" Blackwell, Penniman began recording in a style he had been performing onstage for years, featuring varied rhythm (derived from everything from drum beats he would hear in his voice to the sounds of trains he would hear thundering by him as a child), a heavy backbeat, funky saxophone grooves, over-the-top gospel-style singing, moans, screams, and other emotive inflections, accompanied by a combination of boogie-woogie and rhythm and blues music. This new music, which included an original injection of funk into the rock and roll beat, inspired many of the greatest recording artists of the twentieth century and beyond, including James Brown, Elvis Presley, Otis Redding, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Michael Jackson, and generations of other rhythm & blues, rock, soul, as well as funk and rap artists.\nOn October 12, 1957, while at the height of stardom, Penniman abruptly quit rock and roll music and became a born-again Christian. He had charted seventeen original hits in less than three years. In January 1958, he enrolled in and attended Bible college to become a preacher and evangelist and began recording and performing only gospel music for a number of years. He then moved back and forth from rock and roll to the ministry, until he was able to reconcile the two roles in later life.\nPenniman was among the first group of inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 and one of only four of those artists (along with Ray Charles, James Brown, and Fats Domino) to also receive the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Pioneer Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2003, Penniman was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2007, his 1955 original hit \"Tutti Frutti\" was voted Number 1 by an eclectic panel of renowned recording artists on Mojo's The Top 100 Records That Changed The World, hailing the recording as \"the sound of the birth of rock and roll.\" In 2010, The United States of America's Library of Congress National Recording Registry added the groundbreaking recording to its registry, claiming that the hit, with its original â€œA-wop-bop-a-loo-mop-a-lop-bam-boom!â€ a cappella introduction, heralded a new era in music.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "During the 1980s, rock had become completely segregated and predictable, the opposite of the late '60s/early '70s, when such musically and ethnically varied artists as Jimi Hendrix, Sly & the Family Stone, and Santana ruled the Earth. But bands such as New York's Living Colour helped break down the doors by the end of the '80s, leading to a much more open-minded musical landscape that would eventually pave the way for future bands (Rage Against the Machine, Sevendust, etc.). The group (singer Corey Glover, guitarist Vernon Reid, bassist Muzz Skillings, and drummer Will Calhoun) first formed in the mid-'80s, with Reid being the only member with real prior band experience; he was a member of Ronald Shannon Jackson's experimental jazz outfit, and had recorded with Defunkt, Public Enemy, as well as issuing a solo album with Bill Frisell, 1984's Smash & Scatteration.\n\nIt took the fledgling band a few years for their sound to gel, as they honed their act at N.Y.C.'s famed CBGB's. But the group found an unlikely supporter in Mick Jagger, who took the band under his wing, produced a demo for the quartet, and helped them secure a record deal with Epic (just prior, Glover had to take a brief leave of absence from the band, as he landed a role in Oliver Stone's Vietnam War epic movie, Platoon). Living Colour's debut album, Vivid, was issued in the summer of 1988, yet it would take a few months for momentum to build. By the winter, the band's striking video for their anthem \"Cult of Personality\" was all over MTV, pushing Vivid to the upper reaches of the charts and to platinum certification. Living Colour also took home their first of several Grammy Awards, as \"Cult\" won Best Hard Rock Performance at the 1989 ceremony, and the band supported the release with a string of dates opening stadiums for the Rolling Stones' first U.S. tour in eight years that autumn.\n\nStarting with Vivid and continuing on future albums, the band showed that rock could still convey a message (as evidenced by such tracks as \"Open Letter to a Landlord,\" \"Funny Vibe,\" among others). The quartet regrouped a year later for their sophomore effort, Time's Up, an album that performed respectably on the charts but failed to live up to the expectations of their smash debut. An appearance at the inaugural Lollapalooza tour in the summer of 1991 kept the group in the public's eye, as did an EP of outtakes, Biscuits. Skillings left the group shortly thereafter (replaced by studio vet Doug Wimbish), as their darkest and most challenging release yet, Stain, was issued in 1993. Although it failed to sell as well as its predecessors, it retained the band's large and dedicated following, as Living Colour appeared to be entering an interesting and groundbreaking new musical phase of their career. The band began writing the following year for what would be their fourth full-length, but an inability to settle on a single musical direction caused friction between the members, leading to Living Colour's demise in early 1995.\n\nIn the wake of Living Colour's split, all of its former members pursued other projects. Reid issued a solo album, 1996's Mistaken Identity (as well as guesting on other artists recordings), while Glover attempted to launch a career as a solo artist, issuing the overlooked Hymns in 1998 and finding time to appear as a VJ on VH1 and acting in the 1996 movie Loose Women. Calhoun and Wimbish remained together and launched a new outfit, the drum'n'bass-inspired Jungle Funk, who issued a self-titled debut release in 1997 (Wimbish also issued a solo album, Trippy Notes for Bass, in 1999). With Living Colour out of commission for several years by the early 21st century, Calhoun and Wimbish teamed up once more with Glover in a new outfit, Headfake, playing often in the New York City area. A few days before Christmas in 2000, Headfake played a show at CBGB's, and were joined on-stage by Reid, which led to rumors of an impending Living Colour reunion. The rumors proved to be true, as Living Colour launched their first tour together in six years during the summer of 2001. In 2003, Living Colour returned with a deal with Sanctuary and their most experimental release to date, CollideÃ¸scope. Two years later the rarities collection What's Your Favorite Color? was released, followed by Everything Is Possible: The Very Best of Living Colour in 2006 and the all new Chair in the Doorway in 2009.",

He was best known as guitarist, vocalist, and principal songwriter of The Velvet Underground, and for his solo career, which spanned several decades. Though the Velvet Underground were a commercial failure in the late 1960s, the group gained a considerable cult following in the years since its demise and has gone on to become one of the most widely cited and influential bands of the era. As the Velvet Underground's principal songwriter, Reed wrote about subjects of personal experience that rarely had been examined so openly in rock and roll, including sexuality and drug culture.\nAfter his departure from the group, Reed began a solo career in 1971. He had a hit the following year with \"Walk on the Wild Side\", although he subsequently lacked the mainstream commercial success its chart status seemed to indicate. Reed's work as a solo artist frustrated critics wishing for a return of the Velvet Underground. In 1975, Reed released a double album of feedback loops, Metal Machine Music, upon which he later commented, \"No one is supposed to be able to do a thing like that and survive.\"\nIn 2008, Reed married performance artist Laurie Anderson.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Louis Armstrong (August 4, 1901 – July 6, 1971), nicknamed Satchmo or Pops, was an American jazz trumpeter and singer from New Orleans, Louisiana.\nComing to prominence in the 1920s as an \"inventive\" cornet and trumpet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. With his instantly-recognizable gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also greatly skilled at scat singing (vocalizing using sounds and syllables instead of actual lyrics).\nRenowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong's influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to \"cross over\", whose skin-color was secondary to his music in an America that was severely racially divided. He rarely publicly politicized his race, often to the dismay of fellow African-Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation during the Little Rock Crisis. His artistry and personality allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society that were highly restricted for a black man.",

The original band line-up consisted of vocalist Rob Tyner, guitarists Wayne Kramer and Fred \"Sonic\" Smith, bassist Michael Davis, and drummer Dennis Thompson. \"Crystallizing the counterculture movement at its most volatile and threatening\", according to Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the MC5's far left political ties and anti-establishment lyrics and music positioned them as emerging innovators of the punk movement in the United States. Their loud, energetic style of back-to-basics rock 'n' roll included elements of garage rock, hard rock, blues rock, and psychedelic rock.\nThe MC5 had a promising beginning which earned them a January 1969 cover appearance in Rolling Stone and a story written by Eric Ehrmann even before their debut album was released. They developed a reputation for energetic and polemical live performances, one of which was recorded as their 1969 debut album Kick Out the Jams. Their initial run was ultimately short-lived, though within just a few years of their dissolution in 1972, the MC5 were often cited as one of the most important American hard rock groups of their era. Their three albums are regarded by many as classics, and their song \"Kick Out the Jams\" is widely covered.\nTyner died of a heart attack in late 1991 at the age of 46. Smith also died of a heart attack in 1994 at the age of 45. The remaining three members of the band reformed in 2003 with The Dictators' singer Handsome Dick Manitoba as its new vocalist, and this reformed line-up occasionally performed live over the next nine years until Davis died of liver failure in February 2012 at the age of 68.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Madonna (born Madonna Louise Ciccone; August 16, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, dancer and entrepreneur. She has sold more than 300 million records worldwide and is recognized as the world's top-selling female recording artist of all time by Guinness World Records. Considered to be one of the \"25 Most Powerful Women of the Past Century\" by Time for being an influential figure in contemporary music, she is known for continuously reinventing both her music and image, and for retaining a standard of autonomy within the recording industry. Critics have praised her diverse musical productions which have also served as a lightning rod for controversy.\nBorn in Bay City, Michigan, Madonna moved to New York City in 1977 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing in the music groups Breakfast Club and Emmy, she released her debut album in 1983. She followed it with a series of albums that attained immense popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music and imagery in her music videos, which became a fixture on MTV. Throughout her career, many of her songs have hit number one on the record charts, including \"Like a Virgin\", \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"Like a Prayer\", \"Vogue\", \"Frozen\", \"Music\", \"Hung Up\", and \"4 Minutes\".\nAlthough she received generally positive reviews for her role in Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), her later film appearances received mixed commentary. She received critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Evita (1996), but has received harsh feedback for other performances. Her other ventures include: fashion design, writing children's books, and film directing and producing. She has been acclaimed as a businesswoman. In 1992, she founded entertainment company Maverick as a joint venture with Time Warner. In 2007, she signed an unprecedented US $120 million contract with Live Nation.\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Madonna is the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century and the second top-selling female artist in the United States, with 64 million certified albums. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked her at number two, behind only The Beatles, on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, making her the most successful solo artist in the history of the chart. She was also inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the same year. In 2012, she was crowned the \"Greatest Woman In Music\" by VH1.",

The band is also known for a loud and emphatic sound. In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that \"these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... so it's nice to be one of the few bands that's actually doing that\". In 1984, the band was included in the Guinness Book of World Records for delivering the loudest performance, a record which they have since broken on two occasions. They also hold the world record for the longest heavy metal concert after playing for five hours and 1 minute in Bulgaria (at Kavarna Rock Fest) in 2008. They also have been known for their slogan \"Death to false metal\". Although the band has never been a mainstream commercial success in the United States, they maintain a strong cult following. As of 2019, Manowar has sold more than 20 million records worldwide.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1970) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. She made her recording debut in 1990 under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola, and released her self-titled debut studio album, Mariah Carey. The album went multi-platinum and spawned four consecutive number one singles, on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Following her marriage to Mottola in 1993, a series of hit records, including Emotions (1991), Music Box (1993) and Merry Christmas (1994), established her position as Columbia's highest-selling act. Daydream (1995), made music history when the second single, \"One Sweet Day\" a duet with Boyz II Men, spent a record sixteen weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100, and remains the longest-running number-one song in US chart history. During the recording of the album Carey began to deviate from her pop background, and slowly traversed into R&B and Hip-hop. After her separation from Mottola, this musical change was evident with the release of Butterfly (1997).\nCarey left Columbia in 2000, and signed a record-breaking $100 million recording contract with Virgin Records. In 2001, Carey ventured into film with Glitter (2001). Before the film's release she suffered a physical and emotional breakdown and was hospitalized for severe exhaustion. Following the film's poor reception, she was bought out of her recording contract for $50 million, which led to a decline in her career. She signed a multi-million dollar contract deal with Island Records in 2002, and after an unsuccessful period, returned to the top of music charts with The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Its second single \"We Belong Together\" became her most successful single of the 2000s, and was later named \"Song of the Decade\" by Billboard. Carey once again ventured into film, and starred in Precious (2009). Her role in the film was well-received, and she was awarded the \"Breakthrough Performance Award\" at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and a NAACP Image Award nomination.\nIn a career spanning over two decades, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. In 1998, she was honored as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards. Carey was also named the best-selling female artist of the millennium in 2000. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the third-best-selling female artist in the United States, with 63 million certified albums. With the release of \"Touch My Body\" (2008), Carey gained her eighteenth number one single in the United States, more than any other solo artist. Aside from her commercial accomplishments, Carey has won five Grammy Awards, and is famed for her five-octave vocal range, power, melismatic style and signature use of the whistle register.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Marilyn Manson is an American rock band from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Formed in 1989 by Marilyn Manson and Daisy Berkowitz, the group was originally named Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids with their uniquely theatrical performances gathering a local cult following in the early 1990s. This attention subsequently developed into a worldwide fanbase. The band's lineup has changed between many of their album releases. The current members of Marilyn Manson are the eponymous lead singer, guitarist Twiggy Ramirez (who previously played bass), bassist Fred Sablan and touring drummer Jason Sutter.\nAlthough grounded in industrial metal, the band has come to be known for altering both its image and its musical trappings frequently; the group's sound incorporating, at various stages, elements of spoken word poetry, glam rock, vaudeville and burlesque. Up until 1996, the name of each member was originally created by combining the first name of an iconic female sex symbol and the last name of an iconic serial killer (Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson), doing so to demonstrate the odd dichotomy of American society as a critical and, simultaneously, laudatory appraisal of the US and its peculiar culture. The members of the band dress in outlandish makeup and costumes, and have engaged in intentionally shocking behavior both onstage and off. In the past, their lyrics often received criticism for their anti-religious sentiment and references to sex, violence and drugs. Their performances have frequently been called offensive and obscene, and, on several occasions, protests and petitions have led to the group being banned from performing.\nAs this controversy began to wane throughout the 2000s, so did the band's mainstream popularity. Despite this, Jon Wiederhorn of MTV.com, in June 2003, referred to Marilyn Manson as \"the only true artist today\". Marilyn Manson has garnered much success: four of the band's albums have been multi-platinum, and 2 more have been gold, and the band has seen five of its releases debut in the top ten, including two number-one albums. VH1 has ranked Marilyn Manson as the seventy-eighth best rock band on their 100 Great Artists of Hard Rock. Aggregate site AcclaimedMusic.net lists Marilyn Manson number 723 in their artist rank for greatest of all time. Marilyn Manson has sold over 50 million records.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band that originated in Los Angeles, California. Before the current group was established, the original four members, Adam Levine (lead vocals, lead guitar), Jesse Carmichael (rhythm guitar, backing vocals) Mickey Madden (bass guitar) and Ryan Dusick (drums), formed a band, known as Kara's Flowers, in 1994 while they were still in high school. The band, which self-released an album called We Like Digging?, then signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. After the album garnered a tepid response, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college.\nIn 2001, the band changed its image by adding guitarist James Valentine and pursuing a new direction under the name Maroon 5. At this point, Carmichael switched to playing keyboards, which has since become his main instrument in the band. After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with a subsidiary of J Records, Octone Records, and released their debut album, Songs About Jane, in June 2002. The album's lead single, \"Harder to Breathe\", received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. In 2004, the album went platinum and has been dubbed \"the sleeper hit of the millennium\". The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. For the next few years, Maroon 5 toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and produced two live recordings: 2004's 1.22.03.Acoustic and 2005's Live – Friday the 13th. In 2006, Dusick officially left Maroon 5 after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn. The band then recorded their second album, It Won't Be Soon Before Long and released it in May 2007. The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single, \"Makes Me Wonder\", became the band's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100.\nIn September 2010, Maroon 5 released their third studio album Hands All Over, which was re-released in 2011 to include the single \"Moves like Jagger\". While the original version of the album received mixed reviews, \"Moves like Jagger\" reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100. The band released their fourth album, Overexposed, on June 26, 2012. All four singles of the album were highly successful on the Billboard Hot 100, including second single \"One More Night\", which reached number one. In 2014, the band signed with Interscope Records and released their fifth studio album, V. Maroon 5 released a music video for one of their hit songs from this album called \"Sugar\" that currently has over one billion views on Youtube. This video contains all of the band members surprising newlyweds at their wedding reception and performing for them. Fans seemed to respond to this video in a positive manner by giving the video well over four million likes. Overall, this single along with the music video assisted the band in reaching success with their 5th album. The album, which debuted atop the Billboard 200, was recorded with the very-first line-up of six official band members, as keyboardist and backing vocalist PJ Morton became an official member in 2012. The same year, a longtime friend of the band and the bass player of Phantom Planet, Sam Farrar, became an official touring member, playing many different instruments (including guitars, percussion and additional keyboards), singing backing vocals and also providing samples on the MPC. Maroon 5 has sold more than 20 million albums and 70 million singles worldwide.",

As a teenager, he discovered doo-wop and joined local doo-wop groups in the D.C. area. After dropping out of school and briefly enlisting in the United States Air Force, he returned to D.C. where he formed the Marquees, who were first discovered by Bo Diddley and later was mentored by Harvey Fuqua, who changed their name to \"Harvey & The New Moonglows\", recording for Chess Records for two years. Later leaving the Moonglows for a solo career as Harvey Fuqua's protege, he settled for work in Detroit labels such as Anna and Tri-Phi Records before joining Motown in 1961.\nInitially earning pay as a session drummer and encompassing a three-octave vocal range, Gaye eventually became Motown's top-selling solo artist of the 1960s. He was crowned \"The Prince of Motown\" and \"The Prince of Soul\" because of solo hits such as \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)\", \"Ain't That Peculiar\", \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" and his duet singles with singers such as Mary Wells and Tammi Terrell.\nHis early 1970s releases, What's Going On and Let's Get It On paved the way for the concept album format in R&B music in the 1970s while the Let's Get It On and I Want You albums helped influence the quiet storm, urban contemporary and slow jam genres. After a self-imposed tax exile in Europe in the early 1980s, Gaye returned on the 1982 Grammy-Award winning hit, \"Sexual Healing\" and the Midnight Love album. After a violent argument with his father, he was shot dead by him on April 1, 1984.\nIn 2008, the American music magazine Rolling Stone ranked Gaye at number 6 on its list of the Greatest Singers of All Time, and ranked at number 18 on 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and he ranked number 20 on VH1's list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

He was an artist on Sean \"Diddy\" Combs's hip hop label Bad Boy Records. He was introduced as Bad Boy Entertainment's next big artist during the summer of 1996 when he was featured on the remix to 112's debut single, \"Only You\", which peaked at number one on Billboard's Hot Dance Singles Sales chart as well as its Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart. With his soon-to-be-trademarked slow flow, Mase quickly developed a crossover fan base as he was featured on original tracks, as well as remixes, by popular R&B artists such as Brian McKnight, Mariah Carey, Keith Sweat, and Brandy, among others. Puff Daddy (Diddy) featured Mase on \"Mo' Money, Mo' Problems\" from The Notorious B.I.G.'s double-LP Life After Death, the album's biggest hit single. He then featured Mase on several songs on his own debut album, No Way Out: the lead single, \"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down\", which hit number one on the Rap, R&B, and Pop charts, as well as on \"Been Around the World\", which would also reach number one on Billboard's Hot Rap Tracks. By the time Mase released his own debut album, Harlem World, in late 1997, the rapper had become Bad Boy's premier artist, filling the void left by the death of Biggie Smalls. He is married to Twyla Betha and leads an international ministry.",

They have released five full-length albums to date, with their latest album, 2011's The Hunter, debuting at No. 10 on The Billboard 200 chart.\nMastodon was formed on January 13, 2000 after drummer Brann Dailor and guitarist Bill Kelliher had moved to Atlanta from Victor, New York and met bassist/singer Troy Sanders and guitarist/singer Brent Hinds at a High on Fire show. They discovered they had a mutual appreciation of sludge metal bands Melvins and Neurosis and '70s hard-rockers Thin Lizzy, and shortly thereafter formed Mastodon. In an interview in 2009, Kelliher revealed that the first time Hinds attended a practice with the band, he \"showed up so wasted he couldn't play\".\nThe band recorded a demo in 2000, which featured the band's first lead singer, Eric Saner on vocals. Saner left the band for personal reasons after just a couple of months. After recording a four song demo and a 7-inch picture disc through Reptilian Records, Mastodon landed a record deal with Relapse Records in 2001. They released an EP, Lifesblood in 2001 and their first full-length album, Remission, was released in 2002, with the singles \"March of the Fire Ants\" and \"Crusher/Destroyer\" (which was also featured on Tony Hawk's Underground).

Their second album, Mad Season, released in 2000, charted in the top three on the Billboard 200 and was certified 4× Platinum in the United States. Their third album, More Than You Think You Are, released in 2002, was only certified 2x Platinum in the United States, despite its singles receiving significant airplay. Director Bill Draheim documented the band throughout the process while making More Than You Think You Are. The documentary \"Theresville\" was an online extra.\nThe band then went on hiatus in 2004, with rhythm guitarist Adam Gaynor leaving the band in 2005 after performing on the first three studio albums. As a result, Paul Doucette took over rhythm guitar, and the band reunited and released a compilation album, Exile on Mainstream, in 2007, which was certified Gold in the United States. After the release, former Push Stars drummer Ryan MacMillan filled Doucette's vacated drum spot. During this period, Rob Thomas embarked on a successful solo career.

The band has since released 13 studio albums. A pioneer of the American thrash metal movement, Megadeth rose to international fame in the 1980s and was ranked as one of the \"Big Four of Thrash\" along with Metallica, Slayer and Anthrax, who were responsible for creating, developing and popularizing the thrash metal sub-genre. \nDave Mustaine was originally the lead guitarist for Metallica a year after they formed in 1981. He stayed a part of the band until 1983 where he was fired from the group due to his drinking, drug use, violent behavior and personality conflicts with James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich. Two months after being fired, Mustaine and bassist Dave Ellefson formed Megadeth in Los Angeles. Mustaine later said, \"After getting fired from Metallica, all I remember is that I wanted blood. Theirs. I wanted to be faster and heavier than them.\"\nAccording to Mustaine, the name Megadeth represents the annihilation of power, while in itself is a corruption of the term megadeath. In his attempt to upstage his former band, Dave Mustaine wrote more aggressive compositions. One example of this was tempo increases made to his song \"Mechanix\", a song he wrote while in Panic (his speed metal band prior to Metallica), and had performed with Metallica. Mechanix went on to become a mainstay in Metallica's live performances in the form of the slower-paced \"The Four Horsemen\". Mustaine and Ellefson searched for a singer unsuccessfully for six months, eventually agreeing that Mustaine should handle vocal duties. Mustaine also would serve as the band's main lyricist and songwriter in addition to handling rhythm and lead guitar duties.\nIn 1984, Megadeth recorded a three-song demo tape, referred to as the 1984 Demo, featuring Mustaine, Ellefson and drummer Lee Rausch. The demo contained early versions of \"Last Rites/Loved to Death\", \"Skull Beneath the Skin\", and \"Mechanix\". The band did a few live performances in 1984, before replacing Lee Rausch with fusion drummer Gar Samuelson. Megadeth signed with the New York based independent label Combat Records. In December of that year, they added Chris Poland as a second guitarist.",

She signed to 300 Entertainment in November 2018, making her the first female rapper on the label.\n\nEarly life and education\nMegan Pete was born and raised in Houston, Texas. Her mother, Holly Thomas, rapped under the name Holly-Wood and would bring her daughter with her to recording sessions. Instead of putting her in daycare, Megan was brought to the studio by her mother.\n\nPete began writing her own raps at age 14. When she revealed to her mother that she wanted to rap, Thomas required that Pete wait until she was 21 to pursue rapping as a career. Her mother, although impressed by her rapping skills, commented that her lyrics were too suggestive and \"ratchet\" for her young age. Once she began rapping, she continued writing sexual and \"ratchet\" lyrics.\n\nIn 2013, a clip of Pete went viral, where she was battling against male opponents in a cypher while a student at Prairie View A&M University. The viral video helped Pete gain a larger digital presence and following on social media. She has garnered fans by posting her freestyles on her Instagram since college. She refers to her fans as \"hotties\", and credits her hyperactive fan base for her early success. Pete adopted the stage name Megan Thee Stallion because she was referred to as a stallion during adolescence due to her height and beauty. She is 5'10\".\n\nAfter taking time off school, she resumed her studies at Texas Southern University in health administration, where she is a third year student as of 2019.\n\nCareer\nIn 2016, she released her first mixtape, Rich Ratchet, and her first single \"Like a Stallion\" was produced by TA. The next year, she released her first EP, Make It Hot. One song on the EP, \"Last Week in H TX\", has four million YouTube views. In 2017, she released a video, \"Stalli (Freestyle)\" that is a rework of XXXTentacion's \"Look At Me!\"\n\nIn early 2018, Pete signed with 1501 Certified Ent., an indie label in Houston owned by former baseball player Carl Crawford. She then performed at SXSW in March 2018. In June of that year she released a 10-song EP under the label called Tina Snow. The EP is named after her alter ego, who she describes as \"a more raw version\" of herself. She stated in an interview that she is not afraid to talk about sexuality, nor does she feel boxed in to either the \"intelligent\" or \"freak\" dichotomy. The EP was positively received by critics: Eric Torres of Pitchfork.com wrote \"she provided plenty of freak anthems with quotable lyrics to wield against ain’t-shit men\"; Revolt referred to her flow as \"effortless\". Nandi Howard of The Fader referred to her ability to rap with \"electrifying pace and precision\".\n\nIn November 2018, she announced that she had signed with 300 Entertainment; she is the first female rapper to be signed by the label.\n\nIn 2019, she released the single \"Big Ole Freak\" from her EP Tina Snow, and also filmed a music video for the track. The single \"Is it Love This Time\" is sampled throughout the single. On April 15th, 2019 Megan thee Stallion made her first ever entry on Billboard Hot 100 at number 99 with her single \"Big Ole Freak\".\n\nMegan Thee Stallion announced that her first full-length album, Fever, will be released on May 17, 2019. She stated that the new album will introduce her new alter ego \"the college, partying Hot Girl Meg\".\n\nArtistry\nPete is known for the confidence, sensuality, and explicit lyrics. She presents her sexuality throughout her lyrics, videos, and live performances. In an interview with Pitchfork she stated, \"It’s not just about being sexy, it’s about being confident and me being confident in my sexuality.\"\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone she noted, \"I don't feel like we ever really had a female rapper come from Houston or Texas and shut shit down. So that's where I'm coming from.\"\n\nShe cites Pimp C, Biggie Smalls, and Three 6 Mafia as her biggest influences.\n\nAlter egos\nIn multiple interviews, Pete has referred to herself as Tina Snow, one of her alter egos and also the name of her debut EP, Tina Snow. Tina Snow was influenced by Pimp C's alias Tony Snow, and has similar confidence and an unapologetic sexually dominant delivery.\n\n\"Hot Girl Meg\" is another alter ego who embodies Pete's carefree and outgoing side, which she compares to a \"college, party girl.\" Pete plans on debuting \"Hot Girl Meg\" on her upcoming album, Fever.\n\nPersonal life\nOn March 22, 2019, Pete announced through an Instagram Live that her mother and manager, Holly Thomas, had died. She stated in a separate post that her mother had died from a longstanding cancerous brain tumor.\n\nHer mother influenced her decision to get her degree in Health Administration and also helped foster Pete's wish to establish assisted-living facilities in her hometown of Houston, Texas.\n\nIn a 2019 interview with Refinery29, Pete discussed her interest in horror movies and is in the process of writing her first film. Her desire to produce horror films comes from her belief that the current storylines from the genre are unsurprising, disappointing, and repetitive.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Metallica is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles, California. Metallica was formed in 1981 when vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield responded to an advertisement posted by drummer Lars Ulrich in a local newspaper. The band's current line-up comprises founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Lead guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band. Metallica collaborated over a long period with producer Bob Rock, who produced all of the band's albums from 1990 to 2003 and served as a temporary bassist between the departure of Newsted and the hiring of Trujillo.\nThe band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship placed them as one of the founding \"big four\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. The band earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first four albums; their third album Master of Puppets (1986) was described as one of the most influential and heaviest of thrash metal albums. Metallica achieved substantial commercial success with its eponymous fifth album Metallica (1991), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. With this release the band expanded its musical direction, resulting in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience. In 2000, Metallica was among a number of artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band's copyright-protected material for free without consent from any band member. A settlement was reached and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the release of St. Anger (2003) alienated many fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the \"steel-sounding\" snare drum. A film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording of St. Anger and the tensions within the band during that time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nMetallica has released nine studio albums, four live albums, five extended plays, 26 music videos, and 37 singles. The band has won eight Grammy Awards and five of its albums have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The band's eponymous 1991 album has sold over 16 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 110 million records worldwide. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 61st on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. As of December 2012, Metallica is the third best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 54.26 million albums in the U.S. In 2012, Metallica formed the independent record label Blackened Recordings and took full ownership of its albums and videos. As of 2016, the band is in production of its tenth studio album, which is expected to be released later in the year.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, record producer, dancer, and actor. Called the King of Pop, his contributions to music and dance, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.\nThe eighth child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional music scene along with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 in 1964, and began his solo career in 1971. In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. The music videos for his songs, including those of \"Beat It\", \"Billie Jean\", and \"Thriller\" from his 1982 album Thriller, were credited with breaking down racial barriers and with transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. The popularity of these videos helped to bring the then-relatively-new television channel MTV to fame. His 1987 album Bad spawned the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\", \"Bad\", \"The Way You Make Me Feel\", \"Man in the Mirror\", and \"Dirty Diana\", becoming the first album to have five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. With videos such as \"Black or White\" and \"Scream\", he continued to innovate the medium throughout the 1990s, as well as forging a reputation as a touring solo artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous artists of various music genres.\nThriller is the best-selling album of all time, with estimated sales of 65 million copies worldwide. His other albums, including Off the Wall (1979), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory (1995), also rank among the world's best-selling albums. Jackson is one of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice. He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Dance Hall of Fame as the first and only dancer from pop and rock music. His other achievements include multiple Guinness World Records, 13 Grammy Awards, the Grammy Legend Award, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, 26 American Music Awards—more than any other artist—including the \"Artist of the Century\" and \"Artist of the 1980s\", 13 number-one singles in the United States during his solo career,—more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era—and estimated sales of over 400 million records worldwide. Jackson has won hundreds of awards, making him the most awarded recording artist in the history of popular music. He became the first artist in history to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades when \"Love Never Felt So Good\" reached number nine on May 21, 2014. Jackson traveled the world attending events honoring his humanitarianism, and, in 2000, the Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer.\nAspects of Michael Jackson's personal life, including his changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy. In the mid-1990s, he was accused of child sexual abuse, but the civil case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his comeback concert series titled This Is It, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide, and his personal physician, Conrad Murray, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief, and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world. Forbes currently ranks Jackson as the top-earning dead celebrity, a title held for a sixth consecutive year, with $115 million in earnings.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Mika ( born Michael Holbrook Penniman, Jr.; 18 August 1983) is a British singer-songwriter.\nAfter recording his first extended play, Dodgy Holiday EP, Mika released his first full-length studio album, Life in Cartoon Motion, on Island Records in 2007. Life in Cartoon Motion sold more than 5.6 million copies worldwide and helped Mika win a Brit Award-winning Best British Breakthrough act, and receive a Grammy Award nomination. In 2006, Mika started up his company, Dodgy Holiday Tours Limited. Two years later Mika released his second extended play, Songs for Sorrow, of which limited edition copies are now sold out worldwide. In 2009 Mika released his second studio album, The Boy Who Knew Too Much. Finishing his worldwide tour, Mika started writing and recording material for his third album, The Origin of Love, stating it will be \"more simplistic pop, less layered than the last one\". The album will be released on 16 September 2012.\nMika was born in Beirut, the third of five children born to a Syrian mother and an American father. When he was a year old his family was forced to leave war-torn Lebanon and moved to Paris. The first piano piece he learned to play was \"Les Champs-Élysées\", by Joe Dassin. At age seven, he wrote his first song, which he describes as an \"awful\" piano instrumental called \"Angry\". The family moved to London when he was nine years old. There, he attended the Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle, where he experienced severe bullying. He also had problems with dyslexia. In response to these experiences Mika was home-schooled by his mother at the age of 12, for six to eight months. He then attended St Philip's School in Kensington, where he was the head of the Schola Cantorum (the St. Philip's Choir). Later he attended Westminster School and the Royal College of Music, which he left to record his first album at Casablanca Records. He has also slightly altered his given name, Mica, changing the \"c\" to a \"k\" because he was frustrated by how often people would mispronounce it.\n\nMika has one younger brother and one younger sister along with two older sisters. His sister Yasmine, who works as an artist under the nom de plume DaWack, painted the cartoon art for his two albums Life in Cartoon Motion and The Boy Who Knew Too Much, and she is currently a fashion designer. Mika speaks French and Spanish fluently; in an interview on 28 September 2009 with The Chris Moyles Show on BBC Radio 1 he commented that he had taken Mandarin Chinese for 9 years but did not speak it very well; he also mentioned that his three sisters did all speak it fluently. He also speaks a little bit of Arabic with a Lebanese dialect, his mother's native tongue.\n\nAs a child Mika was trained by Alla Ardakov (Ablaberdyeva), a Russian opera professional, and later attended the Royal College of Music in London. His debut radio appearance was on Dermot O'Leary's BBC Radio 2 show in September 2006. He also appeared on Later... with Jools Holland, and on The Friday Night Project on 19 January 2007. Mika is rumoured to have a vocal range of five octaves, but claims that it is actually closer to three and a half octaves.\n\nMika denied allegations that he is steering clear of sexual taboos in order to appeal to the US market, pointing to the song \"Billy Brown\", which is about a married man who has an affair with another man. He is quoted as saying, \"If I was worried about sexual taboos I certainly wouldn't have made the record I made. It has nothing to do with that. It has more to do with self-respect.\" In an interview in the US gay magazine Out he stated that \"there is a way of discussing sexuality without using labels.\"\n\nIn a September 2009 interview in Gay & Night Mika commented on his sexuality: \"I've never ever labelled myself. But having said that; I've never limited my life, I've never limited who I sleep with... Call me whatever you want. Call me bisexual, if you need a term for me...\" Later he stated in an interview with This Is London \"I consider myself label-less because I could fall in love with anybody - literally - any type, any body. I'm not picky.\" In an August 2012 interview with the magazine Instinct, the singer described himself as gay.\n\nIn March 2010, Mika was named in France a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters for services to music.",

She was married to songwriter and music producer Richard Rudolph from 1972 until her death in 1979. They had two children: music engineer Marc Rudolph and actress/comedienne Maya Rudolph.\nRiperton grew up on Chicago's South Side. As a child, she studied music, drama, and dance at Chicago's Lincoln Center. In her teen years, she sang lead vocals for the Chicago-based girl group, The Gems. Her early affiliation with the legendary Chicago-based Chess Records afforded her the opportunity to sing backup for various established artists such as Etta James, Fontella Bass, Ramsey Lewis, Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, and Muddy Waters. While at Chess, Riperton also sang lead for the experimental rock/soul group Rotary Connection, from 1967 to 1971. In 1969 Riperton, along with Rotary Connection, played in the first Catholic Rock Mass at the Liturgical Conference National Convention, Milwaukee Arena, Milwaukee, WI, produced by James F. Colaianni. On April 4, 1975, Riperton reached the apex of her career with her #1 single, \"Lovin' You\". The single was the last release from her 1974 gold album entitled Perfect Angel.\nIn January 1976, Riperton was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a radical mastectomy. By the time of diagnosis, the cancer had metastasized and she was given about six months to live. Despite the grim prognosis, she continued recording and touring. She was one of the first celebrities to go public with her breast cancer diagnosis, but did not disclose she was terminally ill. In 1977, she became a spokesperson for the American Cancer Society. In 1978, she received the American Cancer Society's Courage Award which was presented to her at the White House by President Jimmy Carter. She died at age 31 on July 12, 1979.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Mint Condition is an American R&B band from Saint Paul, Minnesota. Formed in the mid 1980s at Central High School in Saint Paul, Minnesota, its original members were Stokley Williams (lead vocals, drums, percussion), Homer O'Dell (guitar), Larry Waddell (keyboards, piano), Roger Lynch (son of Roger Troutman), Ray Coleman and Kenny Young. Lynch, Coleman and Young all left the group however and were replaced by schoolmates Keri Lewis (keyboards, synthesizer) and Jeffrey Allen (saxophone, keyboards) along with Chicago native Ricky Kinchen (bass). This lineup of Williams, O'Dell, Waddell, Allen, Lewis and Kinchen comprised the classic lineup of the band.\n\nCurrently, this line-up remains intact, with the exception of Lewis, who left the group to focus on his marriage to Toni Braxton and produce for her and other artists. The group is well known for its diverse musical style (able to play anything from traditional jazz to mainstream R&B and rock-based music to funk grooves and even Latin and Jamaican-based rhythms) and also its captivating live performances. The band is also well known for their well written and produced R&B ballads, mainly in the 1990s. They are mostly known for their hits \"Breakin' My Heart (Pretty Brown Eyes)\" (1991) and \"What Kind of Man Would I Be\" (1996).",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Melissa Arnette \"Missy\" Elliott (born July 1, 1971) is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, record producer, dancer and actress. A five-time Grammy Award winner, Elliott, with record sales of over seven million in the United States, is the only female rapper to have six albums certified platinum by the RIAA, including one double platinum for her 2002 album Under Construction. Elliott is known for a series of hits and diverse music videos, including \"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\", \"Hot Boyz\", \"Get Ur Freak On\", \"One Minute Man\", \"4 My People\", \"Work It\", \"Pass That Dutch\", and \"Lose Control\". In addition, she has worked extensively as a songwriter and producer for other artists, both alone and with her fellow producer and childhood friend Timbaland, with whom she received her first production credit on R&B singer Ginuwine's 1996's album Ginuwine...the Bachelor.\nElliott was born on July 1, 1971, in Portsmouth, Virginia. She is the only child of mother Patricia, a power-company coordinator, and father Ronnie, a Marine. At the age of four in 1975, she wanted to be a performer, though she knew no one took her seriously, as she was always the class clown. While her father was a Marine, the family lived in Jacksonville, North Carolina, in a mobile home. Elliott enjoyed school for the friendships she formed and had little interest in school work, though an IQ test classified her above average and she was able to jump two years ahead of her class. This made her feel increasingly isolated, so she purposely failed all her classes, eventually returning to her age-appropriate class. When her father returned from the Marines, they moved back to Virginia, where they lived in a vermin-infested shack.\nElliott's childhood was strongly affected by domestic abuse. Elliotts family were strongly affected by her fathers anger. Elliott refused to stay over at any of her friends' homes for the fear that she would return and find her mother dead. When Elliott was fourteen, she and her mother finally escaped from the father. Her mother told her to pack her things and go to the bus stop as usual. When her father drove past on his way to work, her mother picked Elliott up and took her home to where family relatives were loading the family possessions into a U-Haul truck, leaving her father with only a fork, a spoon, a cup and a blanket. Elliott and her father occasionally talk, but she claims she hasn't forgiven him. She later stated \"When we left, my mother realized how strong she was on her own, and it made me strong. It took her leaving to realize.\"",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Morgan Wallen (born May 13, 1993 in Sneedville, Tennessee) is an American country music artist. He signed with Big Loud Records and released an extended play and a single, \"The Way I Talk.\" His father was a preacher, and as a child, Wallen took piano and violin lessons. He played baseball in college, but chose to look for music instead after an injury. In 2014, he competed in season 6 of The Voice, but was eliminated.\nAt the end of 2016, Wallen signed with Big Loud Records, a label owned by record producer Joey Moi. He released his debut single \"The Way I Talk\" shortly after. In addition, he co-wrote the single \"Preachin 'to the Choir of A Thousand Horses.\" In April 2017, Wallen released a music video for \"The Way I Talk\". She also joined the Florida Georgia Line to set dates on her Dig Your Roots Tour. He’s a passionate singer with a unique sound who grew up in Appalachia, and you’ll be hearing Morgan Wallen before 2016 is over. Wallen moved to Nashville in July 2015, not sure what he would find, but convinced that he should at least give his dreams a legitimate shot. Less than a year later, he’d already been signed to Big Loud Records, recorded some initial tracks with producer Joey Moi (Florida Georgia Line, Jake Owen) and hit the road on his first radio promotion tour.\nIt might appear that Wallen’s on the fast track, but it took him a while to get there. Born in Sneedville, Tennessee (a town that also lays claim as the birthplace of bluegrass pioneer Jimmy Martin), to a hard-rock-lovin’ preacher and contemporary-Christian-devoted teacher, Wallen showed his musical interests early, singing in front of the local congregation at age three and asking for a violin for his fifth birthday. He would soon switch to piano and later add guitar to his arsenal, though he never really imagined it was possible to make a career of it.\n“I didn’t think that was realistic because I had no clue about how the music business worked,” Wallen says. “Even living three hours away, I had no idea about Nashville.”\nInstead, he focused his efforts on baseball, and he was pretty good at it. Playing shortstop and pitcher for Gibbs High School in Corryton, the same school where Kenny Chesney graduated. Wallen earned an offer to continue playing at a major college.\nBut fate intervened. While pitching during his senior year, he felt a pop in his right elbow and would undergo a tendon replacement procedure. While he was able to continue playing guitar and piano, it proved to be the end of his baseball career.\n“Looking back, I’m glad it happened the way it did, because I really actually loved music more than I ever did baseball,” he says.\nThe kind of music almost didn’t matter. Rock, hip-hop, country – he loved it all, particularly the emotional connection that it created between the musician and the listener. But when he wrote, the music was invariably country.\n“Writing music was a way for me to get my feelings out,” he says. “I don’t really express my feelings very much, and I guess it was just a way for me to let some of that go. It’s my safe place.”\nHis mother signed him up to audition for NBC’s The Voice, convinced that he’d do well. Wallen had no idea what to expect – he’d never seen the show – but he was chosen by Usher and was later stolen by Adam Levine. The last song he performed during his run, a cover of Florida Georgia Line’s “Stay,” helped him steer him toward his creative destiny.\n“Honestly, I was just trying to figure out who I was,” he reflects. “I was trying to figure out me as a person, me as an artist. It was one way to do it.”\nDuring his time in California, Wallen met Sergio Sanchez, the lead singer and writer for Jive Records’ hard-rock band Atom Smash. While Sanchez initially served as Wallen’s vocal coach, they hit it off and started co-writing regularly in Knoxville. Armed with new music, Wallen and Sanchez moved to Nashville and became ingrained in the city’s music community. From there, things moved quickly. Wallen’s managers, Dirk Hemsath and Mike Bachta of Working Group Artist Management, set him up to play for William Morris Endeavor’s Kevin Neal, agent for Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line. Neal signed him on the spot. Hemsath and Bachta next sent demos to Big Loud Shirt’s Seth England, hoping to land some co-writing opportunities with songwriters at the publishing company. England was so impressed that he brought Morgan in to audition for his partners in Big Loud Records: Craig Wiseman, Clay Hunnicutt, Kevin “Chief” Zaruk and Joey Moi. They signed Wallen to both the label and the publishing company.\nWallen started woodshedding as a songwriter, working with the likes of Wiseman (“Live Like You Were Dying”), Rodney Clawson (“Dirt”), Chris Tompkins (“Drunk On A Plane”), the Warren Brothers (“Highway Don’t Care”), Tommy Cecil (“Home Alone Tonight”) and Matt Dragstrem (“Sippin’ On Fire”). Meanwhile, Big Loud proved that it was big-league – while Wallen worked on his own music, the label’s first-ever single, Chris Lane’s “Fix,” went into the Top 15 and continued climbing, an unheard-of start for a brand-new label.\nWallen hopes to build a similar story. He headed out on a promotion tour of radio stations in the summer of 2016, giving him a chance to start playing for people again after spending so much of the previous year in writing rooms and the recording studio. The end goal is to be on a stage, making that emotional connection with his distinctive sound. But it takes time to get there.\n“We’ve just really been trying to get the focus on the music,” he says. “If we don’t have that, then there’s no point in playing.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Morgan+Wallen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

His forthright and often contrarian opinions have led to a number of media controversies, and he has also attracted media attention for his advocacy of vegetarianism and animal rights.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Motörhead are an English heavy metal band formed in 1975 by bassist, singer and songwriter Ian Fraser Kilmister, professionally known by his stage name Lemmy, who has remained the sole constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to or one of the earliest members of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nUsually a power trio, Motörhead had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented Motörhead's reputation as one of Britain's foremost rock bands. The band has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, and 15 million in the United States alone.\n \nMotörhead are typically classified as heavy metal, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Motörhead's approach has remained the same over the band's career, preferring to play what they enjoy and do best; their appreciation of early rock and roll is reflected in some of their occasional cover songs. Motörhead's lyrics typically cover such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name \"Motörhead\" is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's horns, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Motörhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as \"War-Pig\" and \"Snaggletooth\".",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The breakup of Cream in late 1968 had consequences that rippled across the rock music world -- in its wake were formed directly such bands as Blind Faith (whose tragedy was they never had a chance to actually become a band) and Ginger Baker's Air Force, as well as the rich solo careers of members Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce. And it yielded -- by way of Cream associate and producer Felix Pappalardi -- something of a successor band in 1969, in the form of Mountain.\nDisraeli Gears\nThe band's history all started with a Long Island-based psychedelic/garage band called the Vagrants, who'd acquired a serious local following and always seemed poised to break out, without ever actually doing so. Their lead guitarist, Leslie West, was a physically outsized figure as well as a musician extraordinaire whose playing had been completely transformed by his experience of hearing Clapton's playing in Cream. the Vagrants and West first crossed paths with Pappalardi in 1968, when he saw their potential and got them signed to Atlantic Records, where he was working as a producer. He had already made a name for himself producing Cream's Disraeli Gears album, and had played numerous background instruments on their follow-up, Wheels of Fire (and on the studio tracks that would form their Goodbye album). He did produce some of the best work that the Vagrants ever released, but none of it sold; and when West left the band in late 1968 to do a solo album, titled Mountain, Pappalardi produced it for him, as well as played keyboards and bass on the record. The results were the most impressive of West's career up to that time, a solid, blues-based hard rock workout, showing off just how profoundly he incorporated Clapton's playing into his own style -- Mountain sounded a great deal like the now-disbanded Cream, and was satisfying enough for the two to form a partnership, also called Mountain. Their first lineup was built around the one used on the album, with N.D. Smart on drums, and Steve Knight added on keyboards, while Pappalardi concentrated on playing the bass. Following a debut performance at the Fillmore West in July 1969, the group played its fourth live performance ever at Woodstock, in front of an audience of several hundred thousand, on a bill with the likes of Jimi Hendrix, the Who, the Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and -- also getting their first national exposure at the same festival -- Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. The event was an auspicious one, even though it was followed by a personnel shift, as Smart was replaced by Corky Laing, West's oldest friend.\nClimbing!\nThe group was signed to the Windfall label and released their debut LP, Mountain Climbing!, in the spring of 1970, accompanied by their debut single, \"Mississippi Queen,\" which reached number 21 in June of 1970. That chart placement doesn't begin to delineate the impact of that single, a hard rock boogie that was a killer showcase for West's guitar and an unlikely piece of Southern-fried rock & roll, coming from the pens of the Queens- and Brooklyn-born West and Pappalardi, and the Canadian-born Laing -- it was as improbable as the California-born John Fogerty authoring \"Born on the Bayou\" or \"Green River,\" and almost as enduring in popular culture. The single may not have reached the Top 20, but the album it was on peaked at number 17, driven by listeners drawn to the single but wanting more from the band behind it, and the high-energy mix of hard rock and blues they generated. And the debut album offered some surprises, such as the quartet's successful digression into progressive rock with \"Theme from an Imaginary Western\" (co-authored by Cream's Jack Bruce, which only further emphasized the indirect connections and musical debt owed the other band). The latter got lots of play on FM radio, as did \"Never in My Life.\"\nNantucket Sleighride\nEqually important to the band's fortunes, they were able to deliver on-stage what they promised on their records -- indeed, their records were a surprisingly accurate representation of their actual sound, except that Mountain was even louder live than they were in the studio. The group scored another hit at the Atlanta International Pop Festival in 1970, alongside the Allman Brothers, Cactus. and others. Mountain's second album, Nantucket Sleighride, was equally successful commercially and unveiled the title track, which would take on epic proportions in concert. Flowers of Evil followed in November of 1971, just ten months after its predecessor, and it began to clearly show the strain of the pace the band had been keeping up since July of 1969 -- half of it consisted of lackluster studio originals, while the other half was a live medley and a concert version of \"Mississippi Queen.\" Lackluster sales and reviews were inevitable, and the impression of a band running on empty was reinforced by their next release, Mountain Live (The Road Goes Ever On) (1972), which had only four cuts on it, all of them characterized by extended solos. Hardcore fans appreciated the record as an extension of their recordings, but many listeners and most critics found it lacking musical cohesion.\nThe Best Of Mountain\nThe group broke up soon after the release of that album, due in part to Pappalardi's concerns about his hearing, which been damaged by the high volume the band generated in concert. He returned to production, while West and Laing -- staying close to their hard rock roots, as well as the orbit whence Pappalardi had come -- teamed up with ex-Cream bassist Jack Bruce as West, Bruce & Laing, a hard rock power trio that cut a brief but memorable swathe of their own across the musical landscape in the early/mid-'70s. Meanwhile, a Best of Mountain LP released in the wake of the breakup helped to sustain interest in the group. And later in 1973, Mountain was back together, West and Pappalardi reactivating the band with Bob Mann on keyboards and guitar and Allan Schwartzberg on drums for a tour of Japan. This resulted in the live double LP Twin Peaks (1974), a much better representation of the group's concert sound, including a 32-minute version of \"Nantucket Sleighride.\" During 1974, in the wake of the second live album, West, Laing, and Pappalardi revived Mountain again to record a studio LP, Avalanche. In subsequent years, West and Laing revived the group for live shows, sometimes joined by Pappalardi; West also performed with his own Leslie West Band. Sadly, Pappalardi was shot and killed by his wife in 1983. Two years later, West and Laing regrouped with Mark Clarke on bass and recorded an album before once again calling it quits. Laing served as PolyGram's A&R vice president in Canada between 1989 and 1995. In 1996, he reunited with West and Clarke for a new Mountain album, Man's World. West and Laing teamed up again in 2002 for another album as Mountain, Mystic Fire. ",

        "strBiographyEN" : "MUDDY WATERS - APRIL 4, 1915 - APRIL 30, 1983\nAnyone who's followed the course of modern popular music is aware of the vast influence exerted on its development by the large numbers of blues artists who collectively shaped and defined the approach to amplified music in the late 1940s and early '50s. Chicago was the pivotal point for the development and dissemination of the modern blues and virtually everything else has flowed, in one way or another, from this rich source.\n\nThe revolution began inauspiciously enough in 1948 with the release of a 78-rpm single by a singer-guitarist called Muddy Waters. Coupled on Aristocrat 1305 were a pair of traditional Mississippi Delta-styled pieces \"I Cant Be Satisfied\" and \"I Feel Like Going Home,\" and on them Waters' dark, majestic singing. Waters' use of amplification gave his guitar playing a new, powerful, striking edge and sonority that introduced to traditional music a sound its listeners found very exciting, comfortably familiar yet strangely compelling and, above all, immensely powerful, urgent.\n\nFrom the start it was he who dominated the music, who led the way-in style, sound, repertoire, instrumentation, in every way-first as a greatly popular club performer from the mid-1940s on and, a few years later, as the most influential recording artist in the new amplified blues idiom. In the years 1948-55 he put forth for definition the fundamental approaches and usages of modern blues in a remarkable series of ground-breaking and, as time has shown, classic records. In the years since, the style Waters delineated has been extended, fragmented, elaborated and otherwise commercialized, but the fundamental earthy, vital, powerful sound of the postwar blues as defined by Muddy and his bandsmen has yet to be excelled-or even equaled, come to that. It's no accident The Rolling Stones chose their name from one of Waters' finest early recordings the choice was merely prophetic, for Muddy and his magnificent bedrock music continue to resonate as thrillingly and powerfully through the music of today as they did back in the late '40s and early '50s when we first heard them.\n\nHe was born McKinley Morganfield-Muddy Waters is a nickname given him in childhood-in the tiny hamlet of Rolling Fork, Mississippi, on April 4, 1915, but from the age of three, when his mother died, was raised by his maternal grandmother in Clarksdale, a small town one hundred miles to the north.\n\nIt is scarcely surprising then that the Delta region has nurtured a tradition of blues singing and playing that reflects the harsh, brutal life there, a music shot through with all the agonized tension, bitterness, stark power and raw passion of life lived at or near the brink of despair. Poised between life and death, the Delta bluesman gave vent to his terror, frustration, rage and passionate humanity in a music that was taut with dark, brooding force and spellbinding intensity that was jagged, harsh, raw as an open wound and profoundly, inexorably, moving. The great Delta blues musicians-Charley Patton, Son House, Tommy Johnson and, especially in Waters' case, the brilliant, tortured Robert Johnson-sang with a naked force, majesty and total conviction that make their music timeless and universal in its power to touch and move us deeply.\n\nGrowing to manhood there, in the very heart of the region that had spawned this magnificent music, Waters was drawn early to its stark, telling, expressive power. He had been working as a farm laborer for several years when at thirteen he took up the harmonica, the instrument on which many blues performers first master the music's rudiments. Four years later he made the switch to guitar. \"You see, I was digging Son House and Robert Johnson.\" The two were the undisputed masters of the region's characteristic \"bottleneck\" style of guitar accompaniment. With this technique the Delta bluesman could utilize the guitar as a perfect extension of his voice, the sliding bottleneck matching the dips, slurs, sliding notes and all the tonal ambiguity of the voice as it is used in singing the blues.\n\nA Within a year, Waters recalled, he had mastered the bottleneck style and the jagged, pulsating rhythms of Delta guitar. He had learned to sing powerfully and expressively in the tightly constricted, pain-filled manner that characterized the best Delta singers. By the time a team of Library of Congress field collectors headed by Alan Lomax visited and recorded Waters for the Library's folksong archives in 1941 (they were looking for Robert Johnson at the time, unaware of his death three years earlier), returning to record him further the following year, he had had several years' local performing experience behind him.\n\nProviding the musical impetus for dancers at rough-and-tumble back country dances, in juke joints, and at picnics, houseparties and other rural entertainments had sharpened the young bluesman's vocal and instrumental abilities to a keen edge. The recordings show the strikingly distinctive power of the young Waters, both as singer and master of Delta bottleneck guitar.\n\nThe following year Muddy put the Delta behind him forever. He moved to Chicago in 1943, and never looked back. But it was not as easy in the Windy City as the young bluesman had imagined. It was the middle of the war and, though times were flush and there was a great deal of money to be earned in the defense industries, the winds of change were blowing uncertainly through the music world.\n\nSpearheading the new blues was Waters. He had persevered with his music. After several years of playing to slowly increasing audiences, first at houseparties and later in small taverns dotted throughout Chicago's huge, sprawling South and West Side black-belt slums, he had begun to record. Ironically enough, it was for Columbia Records that he had made his first recordings as a Chicago bluesman. Unfortunately, the recordings were not issued. Working as a truck driver, Waters had managed to persuade the operators of Aristocrat-later Chess-Records, a small, independent Chicago firm, to record him.\n\nAfter several exploratory recordings made in the company of pianist Sunnyland Slim and bassist Ernest \"Big\" Crawford which made absolutely no impression on the record-buying public, Waters suddenly scored with the single \"I Can't Be Satisfied/I Feel Like Going Home.\" And it is with this record that the history of the modern Chicago blues properly begins. Over the next few years, Waters gathered around him a group of like-minded, country-reared musicians with whom he proceeded to make blues history.\n\nOver the surging rhythmic momentum his group developed so effortlessly, Waters' dark-hued voice chanted the Mississippi blues of his boyhood. In his singing could be heard echoes of the great Delta singers he so admired. Robert Johnson's music, especially, is at the root of so many of Waters' early commercial recordings. But even if the source of the music is not specifically Johnson, it is ultimately based in the traditional blues of his native Mississippi Delta, always the linchpin of Waters' approach to music, as attested by \"Rollin' Stone\" and \"Still A Fool\" (both remarkable reworkings of the Delta standard \"Catfish Blues\"), \"Standing Around Crying,\" \"Rollin' And Tumblin',\" \"Honey Bee,\" among many others.\n\nMuddy WatersFollowing his earliest recordings, made primarily of traditional Mississippi blues staples and his adaptations of them, Muddy slowly broadened the traditional base of his music to incorporate new instrumental sounds and textures. Memorable among these early efforts were the remarkable trio recordings with Little Walter on harmonica and Crawford on bass in support of his incisive amplified bottleneck guitar: \"Louisiana Blues,\" and \"Long Distance Call,\" dating from 1950 or early '51 are justly praised masterpieces of the postwar blues. Waters' regular second guitarist during this period was the empathetic, almost telepathic Jimmy Rogers whose deft, rhythmically unerring playing was unparalleled in the modern blues. A member of Waters' working band from the late 1940s, he was not to make his appearance on a Waters record until the end of 1951, the same time pianist Otis Spann was added to the group's lineup for live performances. With him on board, the modern blues band format and sound was fully settled, documented on such Waters band performances as \"I Just Want To Make Love To You,\" \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" and \"I'm Ready\" (1954), \"Just To Be With You\" (1956) and a host of others.\n\nWith the ensemble finally settled, the final element was added in the form of Willie Dixon the veteran bassist whose abilities as a songwriter of proven talent, versatility and audience-pleasing cleverness enabled Waters to achieve even wider success through the many songs he wrote specifically for, and in some cases helped produce for the singer-guitarist and his crack ensemble. From the middle 1950s Waters' songwriting became almost wholly urban in character, as for example \"She's Nineteen Years Old,\" \"Walkin' Thru The Park,\" \"You Can't Lose What You Ain't Never Had\" and the anthemic \"Got My Mojo Working,\" among others.\n\nAll through the 1950s Waters solidified and extended his initial success with a series of recordings, many of them absolutely brilliant and none less than satisfying, that firmly established his approach as the dominant postwar blues style. Countless groups emulated its brusque, rude force and thrilling sonorities though few were able to match the peerless ensemble integration it attained so consistently and effortlessly. Members of Waters' various bands-guitarists Jimmy Rogers, Sammy Lawhorn and Luther Johnson, harmonica players Little Walter, Junior Wells and James Cotton, pianists Otis Spann and Pinetop Perkins-left to strike out with bands of their own, spreading the Waters gospel further. Later generations of bluesmen took Waters' approach as their birthright: Buddy Guy, Magic Sam, Otis Rush and scores of others-have all been in Waters' debt.\n\nFour decades and more later, the blues of postwar Chicago remain the standard bearers, the yardstick by which all others have been and continue to be measured. Waters, his cohorts and immediate followers had limned definitively the contours of the style, and it was they who extended and reworked the idiom, bringing it to its highest levels. The stage was set for the music's next development, rock-and-roll and its offshoots and permutations.\n\nAs the 1950s gave way to the '60s, blues of the direct, yeasty sort Waters and his bandsmen performed so tellingly became ever less relevant to black listeners who increasingly involved themselves with soul music and its offshoots, the more urbane blues styles of B.B. King and his disciples, and various forms of modern black dance music.\n\nBy this time, however, Waters and other blues performers of his generation had been discovered and taken up by a new audience-young, white and middle-class that had been born of the folk music revival of the late 1950s and swelled even further a few years later by the British blues boom. The bars, taverns and dancehalls of the chitlin' circuit in which he had performed for black dancers and listeners in the previous decade soon had given way to college auditoriums, folksong, blues and jazz clubs and festival stages, both here and abroad, increasing international touring, television appearances and wide acceptance by the rock community, which accorded him the respectful adulation given a founding figure. His young white listeners gained the beauty and majesty of his music.\n\nThrough all this his mentors at Chess Records sought to keep pace with the changing tides in popular music, in response to which they placed Waters in a number of recording contexts they felt would broaden his acceptance even further. The most sensitive and, happily, one of the best received of these productions was the 2-LP set \"Fathers And Sons,\" which paid homage to Waters and his achievements through the sponsorship and participation of several young musicians who had learned directly from him, repaying the favor by using their celebrity to focus attention on him-the brilliant young harmonica player Paul Butterfield and guitarist Michael Bloomfield. In 1977, his long association with Chess at an end, he signed with Blue Sky Records, a label operated by another of his young proteges, the guitarist and singer Johnny Winter, and over the next several years produced four spirited albums under Winter's sympathetic guidance.\n\nMuddy Waters Gettin' DownWaters performed almost uninterruptedly, invariably giving of his best and often, when circumstances conspired to allow it, setting the night on fire with the strength, passion and conviction that only he could muster. He carried his message to countless listeners, first in Chicago, then all the rest of the U.S. and finally, the world. When he died quietly in his sleep on April 30, 1983, in his home in suburban Westmont Illinois, America lost one of the greatest, most influential and enduringly important musicians of the century, one who had reshaped the course of the blues, set it on a new path and, through the influence he exerted on so many other who followed in his trailblazing wake, completely altered the sound, substance and very character of all modern popular music.\n\n-Pete Welding, excerpted from \"Gone to Mainstreet,\" Bluesland, E.P.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Michael Lawrence Tyler (born September 22, 1970), better known by his stage name Mystikal, is an American rapper, and actor from New Orleans. A Persian Gulf war veteran who rose to stardom as a protégé of the rap impresario Master P, Tyler combined powerful, passionate vocals that would range from a conspiratorial whisper to vein-popping screams in the course of a few words, and was constantly accelerating and decelerating his delivery. The sound was new, but not unprecedented, as Tyler's vocals were reminiscent of R&B screamers like Little Richard and James Brown, using piano and saxophone sounds to accentuate the delivery.\n\nMystikal's debut album, Mystikal, was released on New Orleans-based independent record label Big Boy Records in 1994. He found himself in conflict with fellow New Orleans rappers signed to Cash Money Records including U.N.L.V., Lil Wayne and B.G.. They dissed him on tracks like \"Drag 'Em in Tha River\" by U.N.L.V. and \"Fuck Big Boy\" by The B.G.'z. He struck back with the diss \"Beware\" which was on his sophomore effort Mind of Mystikal. Mystikal's sister, Michelle Tyler (whom he had close ties with), sang the chorus on \"Not That Nigga\" and her fate became a major influence on Mystikal's music after her untimely death. The songs \"Dedicated To Michelle Tyler\", \"Murderer\" (both on Mind of Mystikal), \"Murder 2\", \"Shine\" (both on Unpredictable) and \"Murder III\" (on Let's Get Ready) refer to her murder.\n\nMystikal signed to Jive Records and released Mind of Mystikal in 1995. He signed to Master P's No Limit Records in 1996 and released Unpredictable in 1997. He appeared on many of the No Limit albums in 1997-1998. In 1998 he released Ghetto Fabulous. That was his last album with the label, and he left in early 1999 to go on his own.\n\nIn 1999 he began recording his album after leaving No Limit. Let's Get Ready was released in 2000 and contained \"Danger (Been So Long)\", which featured rising pop star Nivea, and was the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs number-one single in June 2001. Let's Get Ready debuted at Number One on the Billboard 200, making it Mystikal's only chart-topping album to date. The album also featured the popular, Neptunes-produced hit \"Shake Ya Ass\". The song retained cult-like popularity and can be heard in the background of numerous movies.\nMystikal's most recent solo release was the 2001 album Tarantula, which contained the hit single, \"Bouncin' Back (Bumpin' Me Against The Wall)\". Though it presented Mystikal's typical and unique flow style, the song also saw a blending of jazz and swing elements with hip-hop. The well received album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album in 2003, and Mystikal was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male Rap Solo Performance that same year. Mystikal was also featured prominently in the single, \"Move Bitch\" by Ludacris as well as \"I Don't Give a Fuck\" by Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz along with Krayzie Bone, both in 2002. In 2003 he starred in the film 13 Dead Men. In 2003, Mystikal was indicted on charges of sexual battery and extortion. On January 15, 2004, he was sentenced to six years in prison after pleading guilty to forcing his hairstylist to perform sex acts. He served the full six years and was released on January 14, 2010.\n\nMystikal headlined a concert at the Mahalia Jackson Theater of the Performing Arts on Mardi Gras, February 16, 2010. Mystikal's first song after being released from prison was an underground track with former No Limit labelmate Fiend entitled \"I Don't Like You\". A few weeks later, Atlanta-based, New Orleans-born R&B artist Lloyd released \"Set Me Free\" featuring Mystikal. The music video for \"Set Me Free\" was released on May 18, 2010 and was shot in New Orleans, primarily from the Calliope Projects.\nIn an interview in May 2010, he stated that he was still obligated to Jive Records for one more album and alluded to the fact that he would be taking the necessary time to ensure the album would be his best to date. He also stated that he had not come up with a name for the album, but stated that he was considering The Big Shake Back. He made a promo song called \"Papercuts\" featuring once again Fiend and the unexpected Lil Wayne. In 2011, He performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos. Mystikal and Busta Rhymes were signed to Cash Money Records by Birdman on November 16 the same year. His first single for the label, \"Original\", was released shortly thereafter and featured new label-mates Birdman and Lil Wayne.\n\nOn June 26, 2003, Michael \"Mystikal\" Tyler pleaded guilty to sexual battery and extortion. On January 15, 2004, Tyler was sentenced to 6 years in state prison after pleading guilty to forcing his hairstylist to perform sex acts. He also admitted to extortion. The rapper and two bodyguards forced the woman to perform oral sex, and accused her of stealing $80,000 in checks. Tyler initially held firm that the incident was consensual. A videotape of the incident was found at his home shortly after the charges were initially made. Negotiations during the trial held the videotape from being entered as evidence and Tyler agreed to the plea bargain offered by the prosecution, avoiding the mandatory life sentence for sexual battery in Louisiana and expecting to receive probation. The case took a twist when the judge viewed the videotape at the sentencing, took into account Tyler's two prior arrests (for drug and gun possession) and had him remanded into custody to begin serving a six-year sentence immediately. Bodyguards Leland \"Pokie\" Ellis and Vercy \"V\" Carter also pleaded guilty to sexual battery.\nIn August 2005, while incarcerated on the state sexual battery and extortion charges, Mystikal was charged federally with two misdemeanor counts of failing to file tax returns for 1998 and 1999. On January 12, 2006, he was convicted in federal court of the tax offenses, but was allowed to serve the one-year federal sentence concurrent with his six-year state sentence. Mystikal was incarcerated at Louisiana's Elayn Hunt Correctional Center. On January 19, 2006, Mystikal was denied parole at a parole board hearing. On January 11, 2007, Mystikal was released from custody on the federal misdemeanor tax convictions (as his one-year sentence had expired), but he remained in custody on the six-year sentence for the Louisiana state felony convictions. The news of his release caused confusion among fans who heard the news and mistakenly thought he had been released on parole. He was released January 14, 2010. After his release, Mystikal was registered as a sex offender. He currently resides in Prarieville, Louisiana.\nAfter his release Mystikal stated:\nâ€œ\tI was gone so long, all the things I achieved, all the accolades I attained, it felt like it was a dream. It felt like I'd never done that stuff. But watch how I shake this world up now - I want reparations.\tâ€\nOn February 22, 2012, Mystikal was arrested again following a dispute with his domestic partner and was later given a misdemeanor charge of domestic abuse battery. He was detained for nine days and then released on bail. On April 16, he was given a three-month jail sentence for violating the terms of his probation that he was given following his release from prison in January 2010. He was given credit for the nine days already served reducing his confinement from 90 days to 81 days. He began serving his sentence on May 14 at the East Baton Rouge Parish Jail. During his incarceration, he appeared in court to be heard on the actual domestic abuse battery charges as well as for a hearing to determine child support payments for his two youngest children. Mystikal was released from jail in mid-August 2012.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Mötley Crüe is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1981. The group was founded by bass guitarist Nikki Sixx and drummer Tommy Lee, who were later joined by lead guitarist Mick Mars and lead singer Vince Neil. Mötley Crüe has been described through the years as the World's Most Notorious Rock Band and has sold more than 80 million album copies worldwide, including 25 million in the U.S.\n\nThe band members have often been noted for their hedonistic lifestyles, and the persona they maintained. All the members have had numerous brushes with the law, spent time in prison, suffered from alcoholism, long addictions to drugs such as cocaine and heroin, had countless escapades with women and are heavily tattooed. Their ninth studio album, Saints of Los Angeles, was released on June 24, 2008, certified Gold album in January 2012. They are currently writing new material for a tenth studio album.\n\nMötley Crüe was formed on January 17, 1981 when bass guitarist Nikki Sixx left the band London and began rehearsing with drummer Tommy Lee and vocalist/guitarist Greg Leon. Lee had worked previously with Leon in a band called Suite 19 and the trio practiced together for some time with Leon eventually deciding not to continue. Tommy took over from previous drummer Butch Brusco. Nikki and Tommy then began a search for new members. Sixx and Lee soon met guitarist Bob \"Mick Mars\" Deal. Mars was quickly auditioned and subsequently hired by Sixx and Lee. Although a lead vocalist named O'Dean was auditioned, Lee had known Vince Neil from their high school days at Charter Oak High School in Covina, California and the two had performed in different bands on the garage band circuit. On seeing him perform with the band Rock Candy at the Starwood in Hollywood, California, Mars suggested they have Neil join the band. At first Neil refused the offer, but as the other members of Rock Candy became involved in outside projects, Neil grew anxious to try something else. When Lee made one final appeal to audition, Neil accepted and was hired April 1, 1981. The newly formed band did not yet have a name. While trying to find a suitable name, Mars remembered an incident which occurred when he was playing with a band called White Horse, when one of the other band members called the group \"a motley looking crew.\" He had remembered the phrase and later copied it down as Mottley Cru-. After modifying the spelling slightly, \"Mötley Crüe\" was eventually selected as the band's name, with the stylistic decision suggested by Neil to add the two sets of metal umlauts supposedly inspired by the German beer Löwenbräu, which the members were drinking at the time.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Nancy Sandra Sinatra (born June 8, 1940) is an American singer and actress. She is the daughter of singer/actor Frank Sinatra, and remains best known for her 1966 signature hit \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\".\nOther defining recordings include \"Sugar Town\", the 1967 number one \"Somethin' Stupid\" (a duet with her father), the title song from the James Bond film You Only Live Twice, several collaborations with Lee Hazlewood such as \"Jackson\", and her cover of Cher's \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\", which features during the opening sequence of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill.\nNancy Sinatra began her career as a singer and actress in the early 1960s, but initially achieved success only in Europe and Japan. In early 1966 she had a transatlantic number-one hit with \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\", which showed her provocative but good-natured style, and which popularized and made her synonymous with go-go boots. The promo clip featured a big-haired Sinatra and six young women in tight tops, go-go boots and mini-skirts. The song was written by Lee Hazlewood, who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets, including the critical and cult favorite \"Some Velvet Morning\". In 1966 and 1967, Sinatra charted with 13 titles, all of which featured Billy Strange as arranger and conductor.\nSinatra also had a brief acting career in the mid-60s including a co-starring role with Elvis Presley in the movie Speedway, and with Peter Fonda in The Wild Angels.",

Aside from rapping, Nas is also an occasional actor and has appeared in feature films such as Hype Williams' directorial debut Belly, Ticker and In Too Deep and the television show Hawaii Five-0.\nHis rise to fame began in 1991 with his feature on hip hop group Main Source's debut album on the track \"Live at the Barbeque\". In the years that followed, Nas garnered attention from music industry A & R's and record labels with more impressive features and a solo single \"Halftime\". His debut album Illmatic, released in 1994 by Columbia Records, received universal acclaim from both critics and the hip hop community and would go on to be widely hailed as a musical landmark and a classic in the genre and is consistently ranked as one of the greatest LP's of all time. His follow up album It Was Written debuted at number 1 on the Billboard Charts, stayed on top for four consecutive weeks and went platinum twice in only two months, propelling Nas to worldwide notoriety.\nFrom 1996 to 2005, Nas was involved in a highly publicized feud with rapper Jay-Z with both artists verbally attacking each other in songs and interviews.

In the early 1990s, Imbruglia was known to audiences as Beth Brennan in the popular Australian soap Neighbours. Three years after leaving the programme, Imbruglia launched a singing career with the international hit, \"Torn\". The subsequent debut album Left of the Middle (1997) sold over 7 million copies worldwide. Further releases, White Lilies Island (2001) and Counting Down the Days (2005), have been unable to match the commercial success of her debut, although the latter did become her first UK #1.\nShe co-starred in the 2003 film Johnny English and made her leading actress debut in the 2009 film Closed for Winter. Imbruglia is ranked #90 on VH1's Top 100 Sexiest Artists.\nNatalie was born on 4 February 1975, in Sydney, Australia, the first of the four daughters to Elliot Imbruglia, her father of Italian descent (originally a Sicilian from Lipari) and Maxene Anderson, her Anglo-Australian mother. Imbruglia grew up in Berkeley Vale, New South Wales, between Sydney and Newcastle. At the age of 15, she moved to Sydney with her family. Imbruglia studied ballet, tap, and highland dancing as a child, hoping to make a career out of it.\nImbruglia auditioned for Australian television commercials and appeared in spots for Coca-Cola and the popular Australian snack Twisties. By age 16, she left high school to start a career in acting. She soon obtained the chance to play a regular role on the Australian soap opera Neighbours. By the end of her second year, she left the show to move to London in 1994, immersing herself in the city's club scene. Natalie occasionally met with Anne Barret, who would become her future manager and convinced her to register a demo with four songs. Her effort paid off and she was signed to BMG Publishing, after coming up with a demo of the song \"Torn\" which greatly impressed RCA Records.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Neil Percival Young, OC, OM (born November 12, 1945) is a Canadian singer-songwriter who is widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians of his generation.\nYoung began performing as a solo artist in Canada in 1960, before moving to California in 1966, where he co-founded the band Buffalo Springfield along with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay, and later joined Crosby, Stills & Nash as a fourth member in 1969. He forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, releasing his first album in 1968; his career has since spanned over 40 years and 34 studio albums, with a continual and uncompromising exploration of musical styles. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as \"one of rock and roll’s greatest songwriters and performers\". He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice: first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997.\nYoung's work is characterized by his distinctive guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and signature alto or high tenor singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments, including piano and harmonica, his idiosyncratic electric and clawhammer acoustic guitar playing are the defining characteristics of a varyingly ragged and melodic sound. While Young has experimented with differing music styles, including swing and electronic music throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into two primary styles: acoustic (folk and country rock) and electric (amplified hard rock, very often in collaboration with the band Crazy Horse). Young has also adopted elements from newer styles such as alternative rock and grunge. His influence on the latter caused some to dub him the \"Godfather of Grunge\".\nYoung has directed (or co-directed) a number of films using the pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/DéjÃ  Vu (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled Linc/Volt. The project involves a 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to Washington, D.C. as an environmentalist example to lawmakers there.\nYoung is an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid. In 1986, Young helped found The Bridge School, an educational organization for children with severe verbal and physical disabilities, and its annual supporting Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his wife Pegi Young (née Morton). Young has three children: sons Zeke (born during his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress) and Ben, who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and daughter Amber Jean who, like Young himself, has epilepsy. Young lives on his ranch in La Honda, California. Although he has lived in northern California since the 1970s and sings as frequently about U.S. themes and subjects as he does about his native country, he retains Canadian citizenship, having no desire to relinquish it. On July 14, 2006, Young was awarded the Order of Manitoba, and on December 30, 2009, was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Neon Trees is an American alternative rock band from Provo, Utah. The band received nationwide exposure in late 2008 when they opened several North American tour dates for the band The Killers. Not long after, the band was signed by Mercury Records and released their first full length album, Habits, in 2010. Their first single \"Animal\" climbed to No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Alternative Rock chart. Formed initially by neighbors Tyler Glenn (vocals, keyboards) and Chris Allen (guitar, vocals) the band made its first home in Provo, eventually adding Branden Campbell (bass guitar, vocals) and Elaine Bradley (drums, percussion, vocals) to the lineup. David Charles also plays with the band as touring guitarist.\nThey first started playing under the name Neon Trees in late 2005 with five original members, Tyler Glenn and Chris Allen from California, and three veterans of the Utah music scene, bass player Mike Liechty, drummer Jason Gibbons and keyboardist Nathan Evans. The band's name originates from the lighted trees on the In-N-Out Burger signs, which inspired Tyler Glenn. In a strange twist of fate, it was later learned that Branden Campbell's father, Steve Campbell, installed the exact neon trees in the In-N-Out that inspired Glenn while working for a sign company out of Las Vegas. The band is well-known throughout Provo and Salt Lake City, Utah, where it was formed. All four members of Neon Trees are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nThey released an EP called Becoming Different People in 2006 during the time of their first tour through California. The EP featured promising songs like \"Snap the Flash,\" \"Sister Stereo,\" \"Modern Romantics,\" \"Ashley Stevenson.\" They also recorded other unreleased tracks during the \"Treehouse Sessions\" in 2006.\nThe band's lineup soon narrowed down to four members with Branden Campbell and Elaine Bradley joining the group on bass and drums, respectively. Shortly thereafter, The Killers' drummer, Ronnie Vannucci Jr., went to watch the band play at a small club in Las Vegas as he had been in a Ska band called \"Attaboy Skip\" with Neon Trees bassist Branden Campbell prior to joining The Killers. Ronnie was impressed, and as a result they were chosen to open for The Killers for a string of dates on their 2008 North American tour. Vannucci later helped the band sign to major label Mercury Records, which was announced in late 2008. Additionally, the group was voted Band of the Year in 2009 by City Weekly, a popular Salt Lake City publication. Branden Campbell also featured as the bassist for Americana group Parlor Hawk on their award winning album Hoarse & Roaring (2010).",

        "strBiographyEN" : "New Edition is an R&B group formed in Boston in 1978. The group reached its height of popularity during the 1980s. They were the progenitors of the boy band movement of the 1980s and 1990s and led the way for groups like New Kids on the Block, Boyz II Men, Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync. The group recorded mostly as a quintet.\nAt the height of their early popularity in 1983, the group consisted of Ronnie DeVoe, Bobby Brown, Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ralph Tresvant. Early hits included songs like 1983's \"Candy Girl\" and 1984's \"Cool It Now\" and \"Mr. Telephone Man\". Brown left in late 1985 to embark on a successful solo career. The group continued for a time with four members, but eventually recruited singer Johnny Gill to record their 1988 album Heart Break. The group went on hiatus in 1990, while its various members worked on side projects, such as the group Bell Biv Devoe. Gill and Tresvant also recorded successful solo albums.\nAll six members of the group reunited in 1996-1997 for the album Home Again, but during the ill-fated follow-up tour both Brown and Bivins quit the group, and the tour had to be canceled. Various reunions have occurred since, usually with the 1987-1990 lineup, though occasionally also including Bobby Brown. Their last studio release was 2004's One Love. As of 2010, two New Edition descendants were recording and touring: Bell Biv Devoe, and Heads of State, featuring Brown, Tresvant, and Gill.\nOn May 3, 2011 New Edition issued a press release on their official website announcing that all six members were reuniting as New Edition to kick off the 30th anniversary celebration of \"Candy Girl\" with their fans.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "New Radicals (styled as Иew Radicals) were an American alternative rock band active in the late 1990s, centered on frontman Gregg Alexander, who wrote and produced all of their songs and was the sole constant member. They released one album, 1998's Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too, an alternative album heavily influenced by the rock and soul of the 1970s, containing—among radio-friendly modern rock tracks and love songs—strong criticism of corporate America.\nThe band is best known for their debut single \"You Get What You Give\", which topped the charts in Canada and New Zealand and became a top 5 hit in the United Kingdom and whose lyrics, which insulted celebrities at the end of the song, provided a minor media spectacle. Tired of touring and promotional interviews, Alexander disbanded the group in mid-1999 before the release of their second single, \"Someday We'll Know\", to focus on writing and producing songs for other artists. As a result, \"Someday We'll Know\" received little attention in most countries and the band is widely considered a one-hit wonder. \"Someday We'll Know\" did however go on to be covered by Hall & Oates on their 2003 album Do It For Love.\nNew Radicals had a \"revolving door policy\" and no permanent members other than Gregg Alexander, who produced, wrote, sang and played various instruments for the band. The only other person considered a relatively constant member was former child actress Danielle Brisebois (All in the Family, Archie Bunker's Place). She acted as background singer and percussionist on the album, at live shows and in the band's music videos. She also co-wrote their second single \"Someday We'll Know\" with Alexander and Debra Holland. Brisebois had previously worked with Alexander on his 1992 album Intoxifornication and on her 1994 solo debut Arrive All Over You.\nMost of the musicians who worked on Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too were hired session musicians, including piano player Paul Gordon, drummers Matt Laug and Josh Freese, Paul McCartney's guitarist Rusty Anderson, guitarist Michael James (who also mixed), bassists Paul Bushnell, Dan Rothchild  and John Pierce, percussionist Lenny Castro, pianist Greg Phillinganes, and producer Rick Nowels, who played piano on two tracks on the album (and who had previously produced Alexander's debut album Michigan Rain). Other musicians who were at some point part of the live line-up include drummer Stuart Johnson, guitarist Bradley Fernquist, keyboardist Jim McGorman and bassist Sasha Krivtsov. The latter two were later also part of the house band in Rock Star: INXS.",

It quickly became a commercial success, peaking at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and being certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) a month after its release. She became the first female solo artist to have seven singles on the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Eunice Kathleen Waymon, better known by her stage name Nina Simone, was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, arranger, and civil rights activist widely associated with jazz music. Simone aspired to become a classical pianist while working in a broad range of styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop.\nBorn the sixth child of a preacher's family in North Carolina, Simone aspired to be a concert pianist. Her musical path changed direction after she was denied a scholarship to the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, despite a well-received audition. Simone was later told by someone working at Curtis that she was rejected because she was black. When she began playing in a small club in Philadelphia to fund her continuing musical education and become a classical pianist she was required to sing as well. She was approached for a recording by Bethlehem Records, and her rendering of \"I Loves You Porgy\" was a hit in the United States in 1958. Over the length of her career Simone recorded more than 40 albums, mostly between 1958 - when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue - and 1974.\nHer musical style arose from a fusion of gospel and pop songs with classical music, in particular with influences from her first inspiration, Johann Sebastian Bach, and accompanied with her expressive jazz-like singing in her characteristic contralto. She injected as much of her classical background into her music as possible to give it more depth and quality, as she felt that pop music was inferior to classical. Her intuitive grasp on the audience-performer relationship was gained from a unique background of playing piano accompaniment for church revivals and sermons regularly from the early age of six years old.\nAfter 20 years of performing, she became involved in the civil rights movement and the direction of her life shifted once again. Simone's music was highly influential in the fight for equal rights in the US.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Nine Inch Nails (abbreviated as NIN, sometimes stylized as NIИ) is an American industrial rock project, founded in 1988 by Trent Reznor in Cleveland, Ohio. As its main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor is the only official member of Nine Inch Nails and remains solely responsible for its direction. Nine Inch Nails' music straddles a wide range of genres. After recording a new album, Reznor (until the 2009 Wave Goodbye Tour) usually assembles a live band to perform with him. The touring band features a revolving lineup that often rearranges songs to fit a live setting. On stage, Nine Inch Nails often employs visual elements to accompany performances, which frequently include light shows.\n\nUnderground music audiences warmly received Nine Inch Nails in its early years. Reznor produced several highly influential records in the 1990s that achieved widespread popularity: many Nine Inch Nails songs became radio hits; two Nine Inch Nails recordings have won Grammy Awards; and their entire catalog has reached record sales exceeding over 30 million albums worldwide, with 11 million sales certified in the United States alone. In 1997, Reznor appeared in Time magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and Spin magazine described him as \"the most vital artist in music.\" In 2004, Rolling Stone placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Despite this acclaim, the band has had several feuds with the corporate side of the recording industry. In 2007, these corporate entanglements resulted in Reznor announcing that Nine Inch Nails would split from its label and release future material independently.\n\nSince 1989, Nine Inch Nails has made eight major studio releases. The most recent releases, Ghosts I-IV and The Slip, both released in 2008, were released under Creative Commons licenses (BY-NC-SA). Both were initially released digitally, with physical releases coming later. The digital release of The Slip was made available completely free of charge. Nine Inch Nails has been nominated for twelve Grammy Awards and won twice for the songs \"Wish\" and \"Happiness in Slavery\", in 1992 and 1995 respectively.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Nirvana was an American rock band that was formed by singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990. Despite releasing only three full-length studio albums in their seven-year career, Nirvana has come to be regarded as one of the most influential and important rock bands of the modern era.\nIn the late 1980s Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album Bleach for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. The band eventually came to develop a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records, Nirvana found unexpected success with \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", the first single from the band's second album Nevermind (1991). Nirvana's sudden success widely popularized alternative rock as a whole, and the band's frontman Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the \"spokesman of a generation\", with Nirvana being considered the \"flagship band\" of Generation X. In response, Nirvana's third studio album, In Utero (1993), featured an abrasive, less-mainstream sound and challenged the group's audience. The album did not match the sales figures of Nevermind, but was still a commercial success and critically acclaimed.\nNirvana's brief run ended following the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994, but various posthumous releases have been issued since, overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. Since its debut, the band has sold over 25 million records in the United States alone, and over 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, in its first year of eligibility.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds are an English rock band formed in 2011 as the solo moniker of former Oasis lead guitarist/songwriter Noel Gallagher. The band originates from Manchester and includes former Oasis session pianist Mike Rowe, drummer Jeremy Stacey of The Lemon Trees, The Zutons bassist Russell Pritchard and guitarist Tim Smith. The band also varies guests on their debut album such as the Crouch End Festival Chorus and The Wired Strings.\n\nSince his split from Oasis in August 2009 many speculated that Gallagher might record a solo album. In July 2011, he held a press conference to confirm that this was the case, after denying rumours from his brother Liam Gallagher that he had already heard the tracks featured on it. He also explained that he would be collaborating with Amorphous Androgynous for a second album that is due for release in 2012.\n\nThe singles for Gallagher's debut album are \"The Death of You and Me\", \"If I Had a Gun...\", \"AKA... What a Life!\", \"\"Dream On\"\" and \"Everybody's on the Run\". AKA... What a Life! made its debut on a Vauxhall television advertisement.\n\nGallagher announced that he will begin touring a week after the album is released. He stated, \"We're going to go out on tour a week after the album is out. We're going to start off slow in small theatres. If it's good enough to get bigger than that then it'll get bigger than that. I don't think there'll be a huge great big tour this year. I think this year it'll be a quick whizz around the world and try and do the major cities and then it will probably be a bigger tour next year.\"\n\nGallagher explained in an interview with Jonathan Ross on The Jonathan Ross Show that the inspiration for the band's name was from two sources. The idea to prefix the name with \"Noel Gallagher's\" was formed whilst washing up dishes listening to the album Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, while the latter part of the name is taken from the song \"High Flying Bird\" by Jefferson Airplane.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Oasis were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. Originally known as The Rain, the group was formed by Liam Gallagher (vocals and tambourine), Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs (guitar), Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums, percussion), who were soon joined by Liam's older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar and vocals). They have had eight UK number-one singles and eight UK number-one albums, and won fifteen NME Awards, nine Q Awards, four MTV Europe Music Awards and six Brit Awards, including one in 2007 for outstanding contribution to music and one for the best album of the last 30 years as voted by the BBC Radio 2 listeners; they have been nominated for three Grammy Awards. As of 2009, the band have sold an estimated 70 million records worldwide. The band were listed in the Guinness Book of World Records in 2010 for \"Longest Top 10 UK Chart Run by a Group\" after an unprecedented run of 22 top 10 hits in the UK. The band also holds the Guinness World Record for being the most successful act in the UK between the years 1995 and 2005, spending 765 weeks in the Top 75 singles and albums charts.\nIts members were signed to independent record label Creation Records and afterwards released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe in 1994. The following year, the band recorded (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995) with their new drummer Alan White in the midst of rivalry with Britpop peers Blur in the charts. The Gallagher brothers featured regularly in tabloid newspapers for their sibling disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1997, Oasis released their third album, Be Here Now, and although it became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, the album's popularity tapered off quickly. The band lost members Paul McGuigan and Paul Arthurs as they went on to record and release Standing on the Shoulder of Giants in 2000 and were replaced by Gem Archer and Andy Bell who joined the group for the tour in support of Giants. The band found renewed success and popularity starting with 2005's Don't Believe the Truth. In August 2009, Noel Gallagher announced his departure from the band after a backstage altercation with Liam before a festival appearance. The band, comprising the remaining members of Oasis and led by Liam Gallagher, decided to continue working together under the name Beady Eye, while Noel went on to form his solo project Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.\nOasis evolved from an earlier band called The Rain, composed of Paul McGuigan (bass guitar), Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs (guitar), Tony McCarroll (drums) and Chris Hutton (vocals). Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs auditioned acquaintance Liam Gallagher as a replacement. Liam suggested that the band name be changed to Oasis. This change was inspired by an Inspiral Carpets tour poster that hung in the Gallagher brothers' bedroom. One of the venues the poster listed was the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon, Wiltshire.\nOasis played their first ever live gig on 18 August 1991 at the Boardwalk club in Manchester. Liam's brother Noel Gallagher, who was a roadie for Inspiral Carpets, went with the band to watch his younger brother's band play. Whilst Noel and his friends did not think Oasis sounded particularly spectacular, he did begin to consider the possibility of using his brother's group as a possible outlet for a series of songs he'd been writing for several years. Noel approached the group about joining with the proviso that he would become the band's sole songwriter and leader, and that they would commit to an earnest pursuit of commercial success. \"He had loads of stuff written,\" Arthurs recalled. \"When he walked in, we were a band making a racket with four tunes. All of a sudden, there were loads of ideas.\" Oasis under Noel Gallagher crafted a musical approach that relied on simplicity, with Arthurs and McGuigan restricted to playing barred chords and root bass notes; McCarroll playing basic rhythms, and the band's amplifiers turned up to create distortion, Oasis created a sound \"so devoid of finesse and complexity that it came out sounding pretty much unstoppable.\"\nAfter over a year of live shows, rehearsals and a recording of a proper demo (known as the Live Demonstration tape), the band's big break came in May 1993 when they were spotted by Creation Records co-owner Alan McGee. Oasis were invited to play a gig at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut club in Glasgow, Scotland, by a band called Sister Lovers, who shared their rehearsal rooms. Oasis, along with a group of friends, found the money to hire a van and make the journey to Glasgow. When they arrived, they were refused entry to the club as they were not on that night's set list, which reportedly caused the band to bully their way in (although both the band and McGee have given contradicting statements about how they actually managed to get into the club on that night). They were given the opening slot and impressed McGee, who was there to see 18 Wheeler, one of his own bands, that night. McGee was so impressed by what he saw he signed the band to Creation four days later. Due to problems securing an American contract, Oasis ended up signing a worldwide contract with Sony, which in turn licensed Oasis to Creation in the UK.\nFollowing a limited white label release of the demo of their song \"Columbia\", their first single, \"Supersonic\", was released in April 1994, reaching number 31 in the charts. The release was followed by \"Shakermaker\". This song would become the subject of a plagiarism suit, with Oasis paying $500,000 in damages. Their third single, \"Live Forever\", was their first to enter the top ten of the UK charts. After troubled recording and mixing sessions, their debut album, Definitely Maybe, was released in September 1994, entering the charts at number one, and at the time becoming the fastest selling debut album in the UK.\nThe best part of a year of constant live performances and recordings, along with a hedonistic lifestyle, were taking their toll on the band. This behaviour culminated during a gig in Los Angeles in September 1994 where Liam was under the influence of crystal meth, leading to an inept performance during which he made offensive remarks about American audiences and assaulted Noel with a tambourine. The incident upset Noel to such an extent that he temporarily quit the band immediately after and flew to San Francisco (it was from this incident that the song \"Talk Tonight\" was written). He was tracked down by Creation's Tim Abbot and they made a trip to Las Vegas. Once there, Gallagher was persuaded to continue with the band. He reconciled with his brother and the tour resumed in Minneapolis. The group followed up the fourth single from Definitely Maybe, \"Cigarettes & Alcohol\", with the Christmas single \"Whatever\", which entered the British charts at number three. This song would later carry a co-writer's credit for Neil Innes, who sued and also won damages.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Ohio Players are a funk and R&B band whose heyday was in the mid- to late 1970s. They formed in Dayton, Ohio in 1959 as the Ohio Untouchables, and initially included members Robert Ward (vocals/guitar), Marshall \"Rock\" Jones (bass), Clarence \"Satch\" Satchell (saxophone/guitar), Cornelius Johnson (drums), and Ralph \"Pee Wee\" Middlebrooks (trumpet/trombone). The Ohio Untouchables broke up in 1963, with Ward leaving for a solo career, but the core members of the group returned to Dayton and added Gary Webster (drums) and Leroy \"Sugarfoot\" Bonner (guitar) in 1964. The group added two more singers, Bobby Lee Fears and Dutch Robinson, and became the house band for New York City-based Compass Records in 1967. They soon became one of the better known R&B bands of the 1970's. They inspired many artists including The Mighty Majors (\"You Can Never Go Back\"), which opened a show for them once on the road.  Their song \"Runnin' from the Devil\" inspired the Van Halen song \"Runnin' With the Devil\".  The group disbanded again in 1970. After again reforming with a line-up including Bonner, Satchell, Middlebrooks, Jones, Webster, trumpeter Bruce Napier, trombonist Marvin Pierce, and keyboardist Walter \"Junie\" Morrison, the Players had a minor hit on the Detroit-based Westbound label in 1971 with \"Pain\" which reached the Billboard R&B Top 40. Detroit vocalist Dale Allen shared co-lead vocals on some of the early Westbound material, although not credited on the albums \"Pain\" and \"Pleasure\".  The band's first big hit was \"Funky Worm\", which hit #1 on the Billboard R&B Charts and made the pop Top 15 in May 1973. The band signed with Mercury Records in 1974. By this time, their lineup had changed again, with keyboardist Billy Beck instead of Morrison and Jimmy \"Diamond\" Williams on drums instead of Webster. On later album releases, they added second guitarist/vocalist Clarence 'Chet' Willis and conga player Robert \"Rumba\" Jones to the lineup. Bonner sang lead vocals on most of the band's hits.  The band had seven Top 40 hits between 1973 and 1976, including \"Fire\" (#1 on both the R&B and pop charts for two weeks and one week respectively in February 1975) and \"Love Rollercoaster\" (#1 on both the R&B and pop charts for 1 week in January 1976). The group's last big hit was \"Who'd She Coo\" a #1 R&B hit in August 1976.  The band became widely known not only for their sound, which has been sampled and copied by countless R&B and hip-hop artists since, but for their sexually provocative album covers, including the cover of 1974's Ecstasy, which featured a man and a woman in a pose of arousal wearing chains and leather, and 1975's Honey, which featured a nude woman holding an overflowing jar of honey and dropping some into her mouth with a ladle.  There is an urban legend that has it that a scream on \"Love Rollercoaster\" that came during the break after the second verse was the sound of someone being murdered in the studio while the track was being recorded. It is widely believed to be the scream of a female model (the nude woman Ester Cordet featured on the image for the Honey album) after being stabbed with a knife by the band's manager. She was complaining that the honey and fibre glass she was sitting on reacted when mixed causing permanent damage to her legs during the image photography, ending her modelling career. She then approached the manager seeking compensation during the recording of \"Love Rollercoaster\" only to be stabbed and attacked.  The Ohio Players then left the scream in as a sick tribute.[1] The band did not discredit this rumor at the time, because, as one band member put it later, \"that makes you sell more records.\" This is just an urban legend however, as are any other disturbing explanations, including a person murdered outside the recording studio (although recording studios are soundproof and the scream would not have been heard), a band member murdering his girlfriend or a cleaning woman in the recording studio, or a real scream taken from a 911 call or a Psychiatric ward.  Clarence Satchell died in January 1996 after he had a brain aneurysm. Ralph Middlebrooks died in November 1997.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers were one of the bands heavily influenced by the Ohio Players, covering \"Love Rollercoaster\" for the film Beavis and Butt-head Do America. In the UK, there was a chain of music and DVD stores named after one of their hit songs, \"Fopp\". \"Fopp\" was also covered by Soundgarden for an EP called Fopp.",

However, his professional success was hampered by frequent legal troubles, including incarceration. He died in late 2004 of a drug overdose, two days before his 36th birthday. Prior to his death, Ol' Dirty Bastard managed to record his third solo album, which has been repeatedly delayed and as of 2012 has not been released.\nJones was often noted for his trademark microphone techniques and his \"outrageously profane, free-associative rhymes delivered in a distinctive half-rapped, half-sung style\". His stage name was derived from a childhood nickname given by RZA, the relevance of which was articulated by Method Man's statement that there was \"no father to his style\".",

Though the group has been through several personnel changes, singer, guitarist, and songwriter Mikael Ã…kerfeldt has remained Opeth's driving force throughout the years. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into their usually lengthy compositions, as well as noticeable influences from black metal and death metal, most notably in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Otis Ray Redding, Jr. (September 9, 1941 - December 10, 1967) was an American soul singer-songwriter, record producer, arranger, and talent scout. He is considered one of the major figures in soul music and rhythm and blues (R&B), and one of the greatest singers in popular music. His open-throated singing was an influence on other soul singers of the 1960s, and he helped to craft the lean and powerful style of R&B that formed the basis of the Stax Sound. After appearing at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, he wrote and recorded \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\", which became the first posthumous number-one record on both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&B charts after his death in a plane crash. The Dock of the Bay reached number one on UK Albums Chart, becoming the first posthumous album to do so.\n\nRedding was born and raised in the American state of Georgia. At age 15, he left school to support his family by working with Little Richard's backing band, The Upsetters, and by playing talent shows for prize money. In 1958, he joined Johnny Jenkins's band, The Pinetoppers, and toured the Southern United States while serving as driver and musician. An unscheduled appearance on a session led to a turning point in his career. He signed a contract with Stax Records and released his debut album, Pain in My Heart, in 1964. This album produced his first Stax single, \"These Arms of Mine\".\n\nAlthough Redding's initial popularity was with African Americans, he later became equally popular among the broader American public. He and his group first played small gigs in the South, then performed at the Whisky a Go Go nightclub, their first concert in the western United States. Internationally, Redding later performed in Paris and London among other venues. Redding's death was devastating for Stax, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. Later Stax discovered that Atlantic Records owned the rights to the entire catalog. Redding received many posthumous accolades, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Because of his influence on other artists, he received the honorific \"King of Soul\".",

Founded by childhood friends Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, Brent Wilson and Urie, Panic! at the Disco recorded its first demos while its members were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released its debut studio album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Popularized by the second single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified double platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker.\n\nInfluenced by 1960s rock bands the Beatles, the Zombies and the Beach Boys, and preceded by the single \"Nine in the Afternoon\", the band's second studio album, Pretty. Odd. (2008) marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, who favored the band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style. The duo subsequently formed a new band, The Young Veins, leaving Urie and Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco.\n\nContinuing as a duo, Urie and Smith released a new single, \"New Perspective\", and recruited Dallon Weekes and Ian Crawford to accompany the band during live performances as bassist and lead guitarist respectively. Weekes was later inducted into the band's lineup as a full-time member in 2010, nearing the end of the recording of the band's third studio album, Vices & Virtues (2011). The album was recorded solely by Urie and Smith, with producers John Feldmann and Butch Walker.\n\nAs a three-piece, Urie, Smith, and Weekes recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, in 2013. Prior to the release of the album, Smith unofficially left the band due to health and drug-related issues, leaving Urie and Weekes as the remaining members. The duo performed with guitarist Kenneth Harris and drummer Dan Pawlovich during live shows.\n\nIn 2015, Smith officially left the band after not performing live with the band since his departure in 2013. Shortly thereafter, Weekes reverted to being a touring member once again, leaving Urie as the only member of the official lineup. In April 2015, \"Hallelujah\" was released as the first single from Panic! at the Disco's fifth studio album, Death of a Bachelor (2016). In December 2017, Weekes officially announced his departure from the band. The band's sixth studio album, Pray for the Wicked, is set to be released on June 22, 2018.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "No band affected the metal world more so than Pantera during the early to mid-'90s. Beginning with its 1990 album Cowboys From Hell, the post-thrash band put to rest any and all remnants of the '80s metal scene, almost single-handedly demolishing any notion that hair metal, speed metal, power metal, et al., were anything but passé. Sure, a lot of critics point toward Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and the subsequent alternative rock explosion as the death knell of '80s-style metal, but you could just as easily point toward Pantera. In fact, most metalheads do exactly that. Looking back, it wasn't like legions of dyed-in-the-wool headbangers suddenly cut their hair and began listening to Seattle grunge bands. Rather, a great many metalheads were heavily affected by the emergence of Pantera, especially the Vulgar Display of Power album, which was unlike any other metal album of the time, emerging as it did in 1992. That album in particular stood out at the time, slowing down the breakneck tempos of thrash and upping the heaviness quotient, as well as changing the vocal style, pushing it more toward hardcore or even grindcore. By the time Pantera unleashed Far Beyond Driven in 1994, they were the most popular metal band in the land, as the frenzy surrounding that Billboard chart-topping album testified. However, the band began to self-destruct around this same time as well. Drug abuse certainly played a role, with lead vocalist Phil Anselmo ODing on heroin at one point, for instance, and tensions within the band also playing a role in its ultimate, acrimonious dissolution. The final nail in Pantera's coffin came during the early to mid-2000s, when Anselmo began engaging himself in a multitude of side projects and when, very sadly, guitarist Dimebag Darrell was bizarrely murdered on-stage in late 2004. This much-publicized murder shone the spotlight back on Pantera for a brief moment, and amid all of the emotional outpours and media commentary, a consensus arose: Pantera had indeed been a landmark band, somewhat undervalued during their reign, with practically every contemporary metal band of the time openly paying tribute to their legacy. \n\nPantera's beginnings date back to the early '80s when the Texas-based band began releasing albums on the Metal Magic label. Originally, the band featured then-teenaged brothers Darrell Abbott (aka Dimebag Darrell and, for a short while, Diamond Darrell) and Vinnie Paul Abbott (aka Vinnie Paul), as well as Rex Brown (aka Rex Rocker) and Terrence Lee (aka Terry Glaze). They debuted in 1983 with Metal Magic, followed by Projects in the Jungle in 1984 and I Am the Night in 1985. Singer Phil Anselmo then replaced Glaze, and the group went on to record Power Metal, an album released in 1988 that eventually scored the group a deal with East West. While these '80s albums are no doubt curious to hear, it's fairly evident that this was a much different Pantera. For the most part, fans and surely the band treat Cowboys From Hell as Pantera's \"official\" debut album featuring the group's longtime lineup: Anselmo (vocals), Dimebag (guitar), Vinnie Paul (drums), and Rex Brown (bass). This album put Pantera on the national metal map, particularly thanks to songs like \"Cemetery Gates\" and the title track. Two years later, Pantera returned with Vulgar Display of Power and solidified their status as an up-and-coming metal band with a unique sound. It took a little while, but Vulgar Display of Power made serious waves among metalheads. MTV certainly played a role, putting the band's videos into relatively heavy rotation, but more than anything, positive word of mouth and explosive live performances did wonders for Pantera, who had a very unique sound for the time. When Far Beyond Driven hit the streets in 1994, Pantera had become the most popular band in the metal land. The album debuted atop the Billboard album charts -- quite a feat for such extreme music! -- and the band continued its seemingly never-ending string of tours, packing sports arenas across America. \n\nWhen Pantera returned in 1996 with their next album, The Great Southern Trendkill, quite a bit had changed. They'd begun experimenting with their sound, slowing down their tempos and moving away from the relentless heaviness of Far Beyond Driven. The album also featured a very bitter, reactionary tone, with a heavy use of vocal overdubbing. (Anselmo's vocals were notably recorded at Trent Reznor's studio, and are quite demonic at times.) Moreover, Anselmo wrote quite a bit about drug abuse in songs like \"Suicide Note\" and \"Living Through Me (Hells' Wrath),\" no doubt alluding to the personal demons and tensions that had begun pulling the band apart. Partly as a result of such experimentation and personal abandon, Trendkill may indeed be Pantera's most curious album. In any event, reactions from fans and critics were mixed, and sales fell. It would be four years before Pantera released another studio album, releasing a stopgap live album in 1997, the fierce Official Live: 101 Proof. During this long interim, rumors swirled and Anselmo further distanced himself from the band, participating in various side projects, among them Down, with which he experienced quite a bit of success. Pantera did reunite, however -- one last time -- for Reinventing the Steel, which was released in 2000 and, like The Great Southern Trendkill, didn't come close to matching the impact of Far Beyond Driven. By this point the band's following had dwindled, and the metal landscape had undergone serious changes with the emergence of alt-metal bands like Korn and Tool, not to mention the likes of Marilyn Manson and Limp Bizkit. \n\nAnd that would be the end of Pantera, with the token greatest-hits albums and whatnot appearing now and then. In the years to follow, the bandmembers busied themselves with side projects, most notably the host of bands fronted by Anselmo. His projects included, among other endeavors, Down, Superjoint Ritual, Viking Crown, and Southern Isolation -- none of which bore much resemblance to Pantera. Meanwhile, Dimebag and Vinnie Paul formed Damageplan, a fairly stable band that sought to pick up where Pantera had left off. In fact, they even played some Pantera songs during their live shows. Following the release of their debut album, New Found Power, and some club shows, Damageplan met a tragic end on December 7, 2004. That night -- 24 years after John Lennon's shooting to the day! -- a homicidal fan shot Dimebag at a small club show in Columbus, OH. The band hadn't gotten more than a song into its show before the murderer breached security, jumped on-stage, and shot the guitarist numerous times at point blank, murdering a few others in the process. The tragedy was big news in the States, grabbing headlines everywhere the day afterward. For a sad moment that day, the spotlight shone once again on Pantera, arguably the greatest metal band of the '90s and, no doubt, one of the greatest and most influential metal bands ever.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Paramore is an American rock band from Franklin, Tennessee, formed in 2004. The band currently consists of lead vocalist Hayley Williams, bassist Jeremy Davis, and guitarist Taylor York. The group released its debut album All We Know Is Falling in 2005, and its second album Riot! in 2007, which was certified Platinum in the US and Ireland and Gold in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK. Brand New Eyes, Paramore's third album, was released in 2009 and is the band's second-highest charting album to date, going platinum in Ireland and the UK, and gold in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Paramore's 2013 self-titled fourth album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard charts in the United States. It was also the No. 1 album in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.\n\nIn 2002, at age 13, vocalist Hayley Williams moved from her hometown Meridian, Mississippi to Franklin, Tennessee where she met brothers Josh Farro and Zac Farro while she was attending a private school. Shortly after arriving, she began taking vocal lessons with Brett Manning. Prior to forming Paramore, Williams and bassist Jeremy Davis, along with friend Kimee Read, took part in a funk cover band called The Factory, while Josh and Zac Farro had practiced together after school. The other members of what was soon to be Paramore had been \"edgy about the whole female thing\" of having Williams as vocalist, but, because they were really good friends, she started writing for them. Williams said of the guys when she first met them, \"They were the first people I met who were as passionate about music as I was.\" \n\nThe band was officially formed by Josh Farro (lead guitar/backing vocals), Zac Farro (drums), Jeremy Davis (bass guitar) and Hayley Williams (lead vocals) in 2004, with the later addition of Williams' neighbor Jason Bynum (rhythm guitar). When Davis showed up, he was stunned to find out the drummer was only twelve years old. He admitted \"I had very, very, very, little faith in everyone in the band because of their age. I remember thinking, 'This is not going to work because this kid is way too young,' but that first day of practice was amazing. I knew we were on to something.\" According to Williams, the name \"Paramore\" came from the maiden name of the mother of one of their first bass players. Once the group learned the meaning of the homophone \"paramour\" (\"secret lover\"), they decided to adopt the name, using the Paramore spelling.\n\nOn December 18, 2010 a message from Hayley, Jeremy, and Taylor was released through Paramore.net stating that Josh and Zac were leaving the band. In the message they stated, \"A couple of months ago, Josh and Zac let us know they would be leaving the band after our show in Orlando last Sunday. None of us were really shocked. For the last year it hasn't seemed as if they wanted to be around anymore. We want Josh and Zac to do something that makes them happy and if that isn't here with us, then we support them finding happiness elsewhere. But we never for a second thought about leaving any of this behind.\" The post also stated that the remaining members had no intention of disbanding. They also added \"As we look back, and now as we look with excitement to the future, in all of this what truly matters are the good times. The pictures of us with our arms around each other, the long van rides, your faces while you sing along as we play. Thank you for getting us right here to this very moment. We look forward to our best times. And we hope you will go there with us.\" The band also confirmed the scheduled South American tour would still happen.\n\nOn January 10, 2011, in an interview with MTV, Hayley Williams said that despite the band losing two of its founding members, they would release new music in 2011, although they had not confirmed if it would be a full album for release, or just a small number of songs. The singer also admitted that Paramore's style was likely to change with the new lineup, but clarified that the band would still retain their core signature sound. On April 18, 2012, Williams announced that the producer for their fourth album was Justin Meldal-Johnsen. Former Lostprophets and current Angels & Airwaves and Nine Inch Nails drummer Ilan Rubin was confirmed to be the session drummer for the recording of the album.  Paramore was officially released on April 5, 2013. The first single from the album, titled \"Now\", was released online on January 22, 2013, and the album's second single, \"Still Into You\", was released on March 14, 2013.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Parliament was a soul funk band most prominent during the 1970s. Both Parliament and its sister act, Funkadelic, were led by George Clinton.\n\nParliament was originally The Parliaments, a doo-wop vocal group based at a Plainfield, New Jersey barbershop. The group was formed in the late 1950s and included George Clinton, Ray Davis, Fuzzy Haskins, Calvin Simon, and Grady Thomas. Clinton was the group leader and manager. The group finally had a hit single in 1967 with \"(I Wanna) Testify\" on Revilot Records. To capitalize, Clinton formed a backing band for a tour, featuring teenage barbershop employee Billy Bass Nelson on bass and his friend Eddie Hazel on guitar, with the lineup eventually rounded out by Tawl Ross on guitar, Tiki Fulwood on drums, and Mickey Atkins on organ.\nDuring a contractual dispute with Revilot, Clinton temporarily lost the rights to the name \"The Parliaments,\" and signed the ensemble to Westbound Records as Funkadelic, which Clinton positioned as a funk-rock band featuring the five touring musicians with the five Parliaments singers as uncredited guests. With Funkadelic as a recording and touring entity in its own right, in 1970 Clinton relaunched the singing group, now known as Parliament, at first featuring the same ten members. Clinton was now the leader of two different acts, Parliament and Funkadelic, which featured the same members but were marketed as creating two different types of funk.\nThe Parliament album entitled Osmium was released on Invictus Records in 1970, and was later reissued on CD with non-album tracks as both Rhenium and First Thangs. Osmium featured a mostly psychedelic soul sound that was more similar to the Funkadelic albums of the period than to the later Parliament albums. The song \"The Breakdown\" was released separately as a single, and reached #30 on the R&B charts in 1971. Due to continuing contractual problems and the fact that Funkadelic releases were more successful at the time, Clinton abandoned the name Parliament until 1974.\nFollowing Osmium, the lineup of Parliament-Funkadelic began going through many changes and was expanded significantly, with the addition of important members such as keyboardist Bernie Worrell in 1970, singer/guitarist Garry Shider in 1971, and bassist Bootsy Collins (recruited from the James Brown backing band) in 1972. Dozens of singers and musicians would contribute to future Parliament-Funkadelic releases. Clinton relaunched Parliament in 1974 and signed the act to Casablanca Records. Parliament, now augmented by the Horny Horns (also recruited from James Brown's band) was positioned as a smoother R&B-based funk ensemble with intricate horn and vocal arrangements, and as a counterpoint to the guitar-based funk-rock of Funkadelic. By this point, Parliament and Funkadelic were touring as a combined entity known as Parliament-Funkadelic or simply P-Funk (which also became the catch-all term for George Clinton's rapidly growing stable of funk artists).\nThe album Up for the Down Stroke was released in 1974, with Chocolate City following in 1975. Both performed strongly on the Billboard R&B charts and were moderately successful on the Pop charts. Parliament began its period of greatest mainstream success with the concept album Mothership Connection (1975), the lyrics of which launched much of the P-Funk mythology. The subsequent albums The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein (1976), Funkentelechy vs. the Placebo Syndrome (1977), and Motor Booty Affair (1978) all reached high on both the R&B and Pop charts, while Funkadelic was also experiencing significant mainstream success. Parliament scored the #1 R&B singles \"Flash Light\" in 1977 and \"Aqua Boogie\" in 1978.\nThe rapidly expanding ensemble of musicians and singers in the Parliament-Funkadelic enterprise, as well as Clinton's problematic management practices, began to take their toll by the late 1970s. Original Parliaments members Fuzzy Haskins, Calvin Simon, and Grady Thomas, who had been with Clinton since the barbershop days in the late 1950s, felt marginalized by the continuous influx of new members and departed acrimoniously in 1977. Other important group members like singer/guitarist Glenn Goins and drummer Jerome Brailey left Parliament-Funkadelic in the late 1970s after disputes over Clinton's management. Two further Parliament albums, Gloryhallastoopid (1979) and Trombipulation (1980) were less successful than the albums from the group's prime 1975-1978 period.\nIn the early 1980s, with legal difficulties arising from the multiple names used by multiple groups, as well as a shakeup at Casablanca Records, George Clinton dissolved Parliament and Funkadelic as recording and touring entities. However, many of the musicians in later versions of the two groups remained employed by Clinton. Clinton continued to release new albums regularly, sometimes under his own name and sometimes under the name George Clinton & the P-Funk All-Stars. The P-Funk All-Stars continued to record and tour into the 1990s and 2000s, and regularly perform classic Parliament songs.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Patricia Mae Andrzejewski was born in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, New York City. Her Polish father, Andrew, was a sheet-metal worker, and her Irish mother, Mildred, a beautician. Her family later moved to North Hamilton Avenue in Lindenhurst, New York, a village within the Long Island town of Babylon.\n\nPatti (as she was known) became interested in theater and began voice lessons, singing her first solo at age eight, at Daniel Street Elementary School, a song called \"It Must Be Spring\". At Lindenhurst Senior High School (1967-71), Benatar participated in musical theater, playing Queen Guinevere in the school production of Camelot, marching in the homecoming parade, singing at the annual Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony, and performing a solo of \"The Christmas Song\" on a holiday recording of the Lindenhurst High School Choir her senior year.\n\nBenatar was cut off from the rock scene in nearby Manhattan. Her musical training was strictly classical and theatrical.\n\nTraining as a coloratura with plans to attend the Juilliard School, Benatar surprised family, friends and teachers by deciding a classical career was not for her and pursued health education at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. At 19, after one year at Stony Brook, she dropped out to marry her high school sweetheart Dennis Benatar, an army draftee who trained at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and then served with the Army Security Agency at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, before being stationed at Fort Lee, Virginia. Specialist (E-4) Dennis Benatar was stationed there for three years, and Pat worked as a bank teller outside Richmond, Virginia.\n\nIn 1973, Benatar quit her job as a bank teller to pursue a singing career after being inspired by a Liza Minnelli concert she saw in Richmond. She got a job as a singing waitress at a flapper-esque nightclub named The Roaring Twenties and got a gig singing in lounge band Coxon's Army, a regular at Sam Miller's basement club. The band garnered enough attention to be the subject of a never-aired PBS special, and the band's bassist Roger Capps also would go on to be the original bass player for the Pat Benatar Band. The period also yielded Benatar's first and only single until her eventual 1979 debut on Chrysalis Records: \"Day Gig\" (1974), Trace Records, written and produced by Coxon's Army band leader Phil Coxon and locally released in Richmond. Her big break came in 1975 at an amateur night at the comedy club Catch a Rising Star in New York. Her rousing rendition of Judy Garland's \"Rock-a-Bye Your Baby With a Dixie Melody\" earned her a call back by club owner Rick Newman, who would become her manager.\n\nThe couple headed back to New York following Dennis' discharge from the army, and Benatar went on to be a regular member at Catch A Rising Star for close to three years, until signing a record contract. She would eventually divorce Dennis Benatar in 1979. Catch A Rising Star was not the only break Benatar got in 1975. She landed the part of Zephyr in Harry Chapin's futuristic rock musical, The Zinger. The production, which debuted on March 19, 1976, at the Performing Arts Foundation's (PAF) Playhouse in Huntington Station, Long Island, ran for a month and also featured Beverly D'Angelo and Christine Lahti. Benatar noted: \"I was 22 by the time I started to sing rock, so at first I was very conscious of technique and I was overly technical. That proved to be inhibiting so it was a disadvantage until I began to sing intuitively. That’s the only way to sing rock - from your gut level feelings. It's the instinct that the best singers have.\"\n\nHalloween 1977 proved a pivotal night in Benatar's early, spandexed stage persona. Rather than change out of the costume she wore to a Halloween contest at the Cafe Figaro in Greenwich Village that evening, she went onstage at Catch a Rising Star in costume. Benatar said: \"I was dressed as a character from this ridiculous B movie called Cat-Women of the Moon.\" Despite performing her usual array of songs, she received a standing ovation.\n\nBetween appearances at Catch a Rising Star and recording commercial jingles for Pepsi Cola and a number of regional concerns, she headlined New York City’s Tramps nightclub from March 29 - April 1, 1978, where her performance impressed representatives from several record companies. She was signed to Chrysalis Records by co-founder Terry Ellis the following week. Benatar recorded her first album, In the Heat of the Night, in June and July 1979.\n\nShe won an unprecedented four consecutive Grammy Awards for Best Female Rock Performance from 1980 to 1983 for her second LP, Crimes of Passion, and the songs \"Fire and Ice\", \"Shadows of the Night\", and \"Love Is a Battlefield\". Of the ten Grammy Award ceremonies in the 1980s, Benatar was nominated for Best Female Rock Performance eight times, including for \"Invincible\" in 1984, \"Sex as a Weapon\" in 1986, \"All Fired Up\" in 1988 and in 1989 for \"Let's Stay Together\".\n\nShe married guitarist and producer Neil Giraldo on 20 February 1982 at Hana, Hawaii. They have two daughters.\n\nBenatar also earned Grammy Award nominations in 1984 for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female with \"We Belong\" and in 1986 for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Duo or Group as a member of Artists United Against Apartheid for their single, \"Sun City\". Benatar is also the winner of three American Music Awards: Favorite Female Pop/Rock Vocalist of 1981 and 1983, and Favorite Female Pop/Rock Video Artist of 1985.\n\nPat Benatar was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame at the Second Induction Award Ceremony and Fundraising Gala held October 30, 2008.",

Part of the early 1960s Nashville sound, Cline successfully \"crossed over\" to pop music. She died at age 30 at the height of her career in a private plane crash. She was one of the most influential, successful and acclaimed female vocalists of the 20th century.  Cline was best known for her rich tone, emotionally expressive and bold contralto voice and her role as a country music industry pioneer. Along with Kitty Wells, she helped pave the way for women as headline performers in the genre. Cline's was cited as an inspiration by singers in several genres. Books, movies, documentaries, articles and stage plays document her life and career.\n\nHer hits began in 1957 with Donn Hecht's \"Walkin' After Midnight\", Harlan Howard's \"I Fall to Pieces\", Hank Cochran's \"She's Got You\", Willie Nelson's \"Crazy\" and ended in 1963 with Don Gibson's \"Sweet Dreams\".  Millions of her records have sold since her death. She won awards and accolades, leading some fans to view her as an icon at the level of Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley. Ten years after her death, in 1973, she became the first female solo artist inducted to the Country Music Hall of Fame. In 1999, she was voted number 11 on VH1's special, The 100 Greatest Women in Rock and Roll, by members and artists of the rock industry.

In 2005, Patti Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture, and in 2007, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On November 17, 2010, she won the National Book Award for her memoir Just Kids. She is also a recipient of the 2011 Polar Music Prize.\n\nPatricia Lee Smith was born in Chicago. Her mother, Beverly, was a waitress, and her father, Grant, worked at the Honeywell plant. She spent her early childhood in Germantown, before her family moved to Woodbury Gardens, Deptford Township, New Jersey, raised Jehovah's Witness. She had a strong religious upbringing and a Bible education, but left organized religion as a teenager because she felt it was too confining; much later, she wrote the line \"Jesus died for somebody's sins, but not mine\" in her cover version of Them's \"Gloria\" in response to this experience. She has described having an avid interest in Tibetan Buddhism around the age of eleven or twelve, saying \"I fell in love with Tibet because their essential mission was to keep a continual stream of prayer\", but that as an adult she sees clear parallels between different forms of religion, and has come to the conclusion that religious dogmas are \"...man-made laws that you can either decide to abide by or not.\" At this early age Smith was exposed to her first records, including Shrimp Boats by Harry Belafonte, Patience and Prudence doing The Money Tree, and Another Side of Bob Dylan, which her mother gave to her. Smith graduated from Deptford Township High School in 1964 and went to work in a factory. She gave birth to her first child, a daughter, on April 26, 1967, and chose to place her for adoption.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Pearl Jam is an American rock band, formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. Since its inception, the band's line-up has comprised Eddie Vedder (lead vocals), Mike McCready (lead guitar), Stone Gossard (rhythm guitar) and Jeff Ament (bass). The band's fifth member is drummer Matt Cameron (also of Soundgarden), who has been with the band since 1998. Boom Gaspar (piano) has also been a session/touring member with the band since 2002. Drummers Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, Dave Abbruzzese and Jack Irons are former members of the band.\nFormed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten, in 1991. One of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s, over the course of the band's career, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make proper music videos or give interviews, and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\"\nTo date, the band has sold nearly 32 million records in the U.S. and an estimated 60 million worldwide. Pearl Jam has outlasted and outsold many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of that decade. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to Pearl Jam as \"the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s.\"",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Percy Faith (April 7, 1908 – February 9, 1976) was a Canadian bandleader, orchestrator, composer and conductor, known for his lush arrangements of pop and Christmas standards. He is often credited with popularizing the \"easy listening\" or \"mood music\" format. Faith became a staple of American popular music in the 1950s and continued well into the 1960s. Though his professional orchestra-leading career began at the height of the swing era, Faith refined and rethought orchestration techniques, including use of large string sections, to soften and fill out the brass-dominated popular music of the 1940s.\nFaith was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. He was the oldest of eight children. His parents, Abraham Faith and Minnie, née Rottenberg, were Jewish. He played violin and piano as a child, and played in theatres and at Massey Hall. After his hands were badly burned in a fire, he turned to conducting, and his live orchestras used the new medium of radio broadcasting.\nBeginning with defunct stations CKNC and CKCL, Faith was a staple of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's live-music broadcasting from 1933 to 1940, when he resettled in Chicago. In the early 1940s, Faith was orchestra leader for the Carnation Contented program on NBC. From 1948-1949 he also served as the orchestra leader on the CBS radio network program The Coca-Cola Hour (also called The Pause That Refreshes). The orchestral accordionist John Serry Sr. collaborated with Faith in these broadcasts.\nIn 1945, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He made many recordings for Voice of America. After working briefly for Decca Records, he worked for Mitch Miller at Columbia Records, where he turned out dozens of albums and provided arrangements for many of the pop singers of the 1950s, including Tony Bennett, Doris Day, Johnny Mathis for Mathis's 1958 Christmas album titled Merry Christmas, and Guy Mitchell for whom Faith wrote Mitchell's number-one single, \"My Heart Cries for You\".\nHis most famous and remembered recordings are \"Delicado\" (1952), \"The Song from Moulin Rouge\" (1953) and \"Theme from A Summer Place\" (1960), which won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year in 1961. Faith remains the only artist to have the best selling single of the year during both the pop singer era (\"Song from Moulin Rouge\") and the rock era (\"Theme from a Summer Place\"); and he is one of only three artists, along with Elvis Presley and The Beatles, to have the best selling single of the year twice. The B-side of \"Song from the Moulin Rouge\" was \"Swedish Rhapsody\" by Hugo Alfvén. In 1961 his fame in Sweden would rise exponentially as his work Mucho Gusto would become the theme music for the sports broadcasts of Sveriges Radio.\nThough Faith initially mined the worlds of Broadway, Hollywood and Latin music for many of his top-selling 1950s recordings, he enjoyed popularity starting in 1962 with his orchestral versions of popular rock and pop hits of the day. His Themes for Young Lovers album was a top seller during this era and introduced the Faith sound to a younger generation of listeners. With the success of Columbia record-mate Ray Conniff's chorus and orchestra during this same time, Faith began using a chorus (usually all female in most of his recordings, but used a mixed chorus on his albums Leaving on a Jet Plane and I Think I Love You, which were released in 1970 and 1971 respectively) in several popular albums from the mid-1960s on. Faith's first single with a female chorus, \"Yellow Days,\" was a substantial hit in the MOR (Middle of the Road) easy listening radio format of the mid-1960s. Faith continued to enjoy airplay and consistent album sales throughout the early 1970s, and received a second Grammy award in 1969 for his album Love Theme from 'Romeo and Juliet'.\nThough best known for his recording career, Faith also occasionally scored motion pictures, and received an Academy Award nomination for his adaptation of the song score for the Doris Day musical feature, Love Me or Leave Me. His other film scores included romantic comedies and dramatic features such as Tammy Tell Me True (1961), I'd Rather Be Rich (1964), The Third Day (1965) and The Oscar (1966). Faith also composed the theme for the NBC series The Virginian.\nWith the advent of harder rock sounds in the 1970s, Faith's elegant arrangements fell out of favour with the listening and record-buying public, although he continued to release albums as diverse and contemporary as Jesus Christ Superstar and Black Magic Woman. He released one album of country music and two albums of disco-oriented arrangements toward the end of his forty-year career, his very last recording being a disco-style reworking of \"Theme from a Summer Place\", titled \"Summer Place '76\", which was a minor and posthumous hit. Faith died of cancer in Encino, California, and was interred in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California. His wife, Mary (Palange) Faith, was born November 24, 1909, and died November 27, 1997, in Los Angeles. They married in 1928 and had 2 children, Marilyn and Peter.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Pierino Ronald \"Perry\" Como (May 18, 1912 – May 12, 2001) was an American singer and television personality. During a career spanning more than half a century, he recorded exclusively for the RCA Victor label after signing with them in 1943. \"Mr. C.\", as he was nicknamed, sold millions of records for Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and pioneered a weekly musical variety television show, which set the standards for the genre and proved to be one of the most successful in television history. Como was seen weekly on television from 1949 to 1963, then continued hosting the Kraft Music Hall variety program on a monthly basis until 1967. His television shows and seasonal specials were broadcast throughout the world. Also a popular recording artist, Perry Como produced numerous hit records; his combined success on television and popular recordings was not matched by any other artist of the time. Como's appeal spanned generations and he was widely respected for both his professional standards and the conduct in his personal life. In the official RCA Records Billboard magazine memorial, his life was summed up in these few words: \"50 years of music and a life well lived. An example to all.\" Composer Ervin Drake said of him, \"... [o]ccasionally someone like Perry comes along and won't 'go with the flow' and still prevails in spite of all the bankrupt others who surround him and importune him to yield to their values. Only occasionally.\"\nOne of the many factors in his success was Como's insistence on his principles of good taste; if he considered something to be in bad or poor taste, it was not in the show or broadcast. When a remark made by Julius La Rosa about television personality Arthur Godfrey on The Perry Como Show was misconstrued, Como offered an on-air apology at the beginning of his next show, against the advice of his staff. While his performance of \"Ave Maria\" was a tradition of his holiday television programs, Como refused to sing it at live performances, saying, \"It's not the time or place to do it\", even though it was the number-one request of his audiences. Another was his naturalness; the man viewers saw on the screen was the same person who could be encountered behind a supermarket shopping cart, at a bowling alley, or in a kitchen making breakfast.[17][18][19] From his first Chesterfield Supper Club television show, if scripts were written at all, they were based on the way Como would say something.[20] Como was not devoid of a temper, and it could be seen at times as a result of the frustrations of daily life. His music director from 1948 – 1963, Mitchell Ayres, said, \"Perry has a temper like everyone else. And he loses his temper at the normal things everyone else does. When we're driving, for instance, and somebody cuts him off, he really lets the offender have it.\"[21][22]\nComo received the 1959 Grammy Award for Best Vocal Performance, Male; five Emmys from 1955 to 1959;[23] a Christopher Award (1956) and shared a Peabody Award with good friend Jackie Gleason in 1956. He was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame in 1990 and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 1987. Posthumously, Como received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002; he was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Como has the distinction of having three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio, television, and music.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Troy Donald Jamerson, better known by his stage name Pharoahe Monch is an African-American rapper. He is known for his complex lyrics, complex delivery, and internal and multisyllabic rhyme schemes.\nPharoahe Monch's name is derived from the monkey doll Monchhichi. After receiving a bad haircut, which left Monch looking like a \"chimpanzee\", girls in Monch's class at the High School of Art and Design began calling him \"Monchhichi\", which was later shortened to \"Monch\". Monch adopted the \"Pharoahe\" prefix after meeting future Organized Konfusion partner Prince Po. \nMonch released three albums as part of the rap duo Organized Konfusion with partner Prince Poetry: The self-titled Organized Konfusion, Stress: The Extinction Agenda and The Equinox. The duo handled a large amount of production on these albums themselves. All albums received positive critical reviews, but moderate sales. As a result, the duo split up after recording their final album The Equinox in 1997. Prince Poetry has since denied the possibility of an Organized Konfusion reunion.\nPharoahe Monch then signed to Rawkus Records, an indie label. After making several guest appearances on albums like the best-selling Rawkus compilation Soundbombing II, Monch's much-hyped debut, Internal Affairs was released in 1999. The first single of the album, \"Simon Says\", became a hit single, peaking at No. 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was also featured in the 2000 cinematic releases Charlie's Angels and Boiler Room. Despite its success, the song caused controversy when Monch was later sued for the song's use of a sample from Akira Ifukube's Gojira Tai Mosura for the hook. The uncleared sample use caused a halting in his album's distribution.\nAfter Internal Affairs and the controversy from his hit song Pharoahe would not release another solo project for several years. He did still make some songs and guest appearances however. In 2000 he featured with Mos Def and Nate Dogg on the hit song \"Oh No\" from the Rawkus compilation record Lyricist Lounge 2. He contributed the song \"Fuck You\" to the Training Day soundtrack in 2001, and rapped the theme song to Madden NFL 2002. In 2003 Pharoahe released his final single through Rawkus Records, \"Agent Orange\", a war inspired song which revisited the 1991 Organized Konfusion track \"Releasing Hypnotical Gases\".\nPharoahe is also affiliated with the rap group The HRSMN. Although not a member of the group (there are only four real members), he is constantly linked to someday join the group when/if they ever expand\nThere were rumors his next album, at first tentatively titled Innervisions, was to be released under Denaun Porter's new Shady Records imprint Runyon Ave. They reached out to Stevie Wonder and were at the beginning processes of recording the album but apparently the deal fell through; Monch later announced a deal with Street Records Corporation, home of Wu-Tang Clan, David Banner and Terror Squad. In June 2007 Monch released his second solo album Desire to critical acclaim. Monch said about the album; \"...it's very soulful, very gospel, a fresh, new sound for me.\" The album's lead single was the self-produced track \"Push\", with \"Let's Go\" as its B-Side. The song's music video and single were released in late September 2006. Pharoahe Monch released a second music video entitled \"When the Gun Draws\" at a Brooklyn music festival in February 2007. The track was inspired by a song he did with Prince Po entitled \"Stray Bullet\" which was featured on the Stress: The Extinction Agenda album. A final video was made for the title track \"Desire\" in late 2007. It was directed by New Zealand director Andy Morton and shot on the Rock the Bells tour with full band. The video features both MeLa Machinko and of course, a huge performance from Showtyme.\nOn July 9, 2010, Pharoahe Monch allowed hip hop website hiphopdx.com to leak a song from his forthcoming album W.A.R. (We Are Renegades). The song was called \"Shine\" and featured vocals by MeLa Machinko and was also produced by Diamond D. On February 14, 2010, another song from Monch was leaked, which is called \"Clap (One Day)\", produced by M-Phazes.\nPharoahe Monch released his third solo album W.A.R. (We Are Renegades) in March 2011. It featured guest appearances from Jill Scott, Styles P, Citizen Cope, Jean Grae, Royce da 5'9\", Immortal Technique, Vernon Reid, Phonte, Mr. Porter, Mela Machinko, Showtyme & DJ Boogie Blind. Pharoahe revealed that the album is a \"throwback to 1993, '94 hip-hop\" and featured production by Exile, Marco Polo, M-Phazes, Fatin, Diamond D, Mike Loe, Samiyam, Adam Deitch, Eric Krasno and Pharoahe Monch himself. Four singles have been released from the album: \"Shine\", \"Clap (One Day)\", \"Black Hand Side\", and \"Assassins\". A ten-year anniversary re-issue of Internal Affairs will also be released featuring a documentary about the making of the album.\nIn 2011, Pharoahe Monch was a judge on the Ultimate MC TV show alongside with Royce da 5'9\", Sean Price, Planet Asia, and Organik\nPharoahe Monch is acclaimed for his complex rapping technique - Allmusic says he has, \"a reputation as one of underground hip hop's pre-eminent lyricists, crafting intricate and intelligent raps.\" Kool Moe Dee ranks him at 26 in his best MCs of all time list, from his book, There's a God on the Mic. Kool Moe Dee notes: \"Pharoahe Monch is like an eloquent linguistics professor moonlighting as a rhyme serial killer terrorist, challenging the listeners' I.Q. while daring him or her to keep up.\"\nMonch compares writing and recording his lyrics to writing and filming a movie - in the book How to Rap he says he will 'punch-in' vocals so he can \"retake some things, just like a film\", and he 'rewrites' lyrics, saying he will \"go back as a screenwriter and rewrite scenes and leave more to the imagination.\"\nFor his biggest hit, \"Simon Says\", he comments that he wrote the choruses before he wrote the verses, and fellow rapper and collaborator O.C. notes that Monch will write single lines down and then use them five years later. His vocal delivery is inspired by Jazz music and musicians such as John Coltrane",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Pink Floyd were an English rock band that achieved international success with their progressive and psychedelic rock music marked by the use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, and elaborate live shows. One of the most commercially successful and influential rock groups in the history of popular music, they have sold over 250 million records worldwide, including 74.5 million certified units in the United States. They were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005.\nThe band originally consisted of university students Roger Waters, Nick Mason, Richard Wright, and Syd Barrett. Founded in 1965, they gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s. Under Barrett's creative leadership they released two charting singles, \"Arnold Layne\" and \"See Emily Play\", and a successful début album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined as a fifth member in December 1967, several months prior to Barrett's April 1968 departure due to deteriorating mental health. With the loss of Syd, the band moved from psychedelic pop to a more progressive sound, with many tracks written collaboratively while on tour. With this line-up they achieved critical and commercial success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). With Animals and The Wall, Waters became the primary songwriter.\nWright was forced by Waters to leave the group in 1979. Following The Final Cut (1983), the group was temporarily disbanded by Waters. Gilmour and Mason reformed in 1985, and were subsequently rejoined by Wright. They continued to record and tour through 1994, despite Waters' failed 1986 attempt to legally prevent them continuing as Pink Floyd; two more albums followed, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994). After almost two decades of acrimony the band reunited in 2005 for a single performance, at the global awareness event Live 8. Wright died in 2008. Surviving members Gilmour and Mason joined Waters at one of his The Wall Tour shows on 12 May 2011 at the O2 Arena in London; Gilmour performed \"Comfortably Numb\" along with Waters and \"Outside the Wall\" with Mason and Waters.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Pixies are an American alternative rock band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1986. The group consists of Black Francis (vocals, rhythm guitar), Joey Santiago (lead guitar), Kim Deal (bass, vocals), and David Lovering (drums). The Pixies achieved relatively modest commercial success in their home country, but were significantly more successful in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe. The group disbanded in 1993 under acrimonious circumstances, but reunited in 2004.\n\nThe band's style of music contains a range of elements, including indie rock, psychedelia, noise rock, and surf rock. Black Francis is the Pixies' primary songwriter and singer. He has written about a number of offbeat subjects in the band's songs, such as extraterrestrials, surrealism, incest, and biblical violence.\n\nThe group is credited as being a big influence on the alternative rock boom of the 1990s. The Pixies' legacy and popularity grew in the years following their break-up, leading to sold-out world tours following their reunion in 2004.\nJoey Santiago and Black Francis (born Charles Thompson IV) first met when they lived next to each other in a suite while attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Although Santiago was worried about distractions, he noticed Francis played music and the pair began to jam together. Francis then embarked on a student exchange trip to Puerto Rico to study Spanish. After six months, he returned to Amherst and dropped out of the university. Francis and Santiago spent 1984 working in a warehouse, with Francis composing songs on his acoustic guitar and writing lyrics on the subway train.\n\nThe pair formed a band in January 1986. Bass player Kim Deal joined Santiago and Francis two weeks later after responding to a classified advertisement Francis had placed, seeking a female bass player who liked both folk music icons Peter, Paul and Mary and the band HÃ¼sker DÃ¼. Deal was the only person to respond, but arrived at the audition without a bass as she had never played the instrument before. She later obtained one, and the trio started rehearsing in Deal's apartment.\n\nAfter recruiting Deal, the band tried unsuccessfully to get her sister, Kelley Deal, to join as its drummer. Kim's husband suggested they hire drummer David Lovering, whom Kim had met at her wedding reception. The group arrived at a name after Santiago selected the word \"pixies\" randomly from a dictionary and took a liking to how it looked and its definition as \"mischievous little elves\". Once the band had settled on a name and stable line-up, they moved rehearsals to Lovering's parents' garage in mid-1986. They began to play shows at bars in and around the Boston area.",

The band was soon joined by drummer Robert Schultzberg, who was later replaced by Steve Hewitt after conflicts with Molko. Hewitt left the band in October 2007 and was replaced by Steve Forrest in 2008. They are known for their androgynous image and angst-fueled musical content. To date, they have released six studio albums, all of which have reached the top 20 in the UK, and have sold over ten million records worldwide.\n\nBrian Molko and Stefan Olsdal had both attended the American International School of Luxembourg, but didn't cross paths properly until 1994 in London, England. At the time, Olsdal was taking guitar lessons and was on his way home when he met Molko at the South Kensington tube station. Molko, observing that Olsdal had a guitar strapped to his back, invited Olsdal to watch him perform at a local bar. On the strength of Molko's performance, Olsdal decided that they should start a band. The two formed Ashtray Heart, a lo-fi duo, playing mostly on toy instruments. They wrote four songs, but decided to try out as a serious band and started to scout for a drummer.\n\nOriginally, the two were unable to decide on a drummer. Molko had some experience playing with Steve Hewitt, making him the ideal choice. However, Hewitt had prior commitments to the London band Breed, and only had time to play on occasional demos with Molko and Olsdal. This led Robert Schultzberg to assume the position of drummer when the band signed its contract with Caroline Records. Schultzberg had known Olsdal from boarding school in Sigtuna, Sweden as well as from an earlier Swedish band, Elevating Addiction, which they had both been members of.",

He first gained major recognition in February 2015, after the release of his debut single \"White Iverson\". In August 2015, Malone landed a record deal with Republic Records.\n\nPost Malone was born Austin Richard Post on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York. When he was 10 years old, he and his family moved to Dallas, Texas. He enjoyed playing basketball and watching sports. His father was the Dallas Cowboys' assistant director of food and beverage, and this meant that he was able to get free food and tickets to Dallas Cowboy games.\n\nPost began to play the guitar and audition for the band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the popular video game Guitar Hero. He first began learning how to produce music through FL Studio. When he was 16 years old, he started working on his first independent mixtape. He showed it to some of his classmates and it garnered him notoriety at his high school. He credited his love for music to his father, who exposed him to music making for all genres, including country music.\n\nPost attended and graduated from Grapevine High School. He then enrolled in Tarrant County College, attending for only a few months.\n\nAfter leaving college, Malone moved from Dallas, Texas to Los Angeles, California, with his longtime friend, named Jason Stokes. He met 1st and Rich from FKi Music, who did some of the production work on several of Malone's tracks, one of which was titled \"White Iverson\". Malone recorded the song two days after he wrote it. \"White Iverson\" is in part, a reference to the professional basketball player Allen Iverson. In February 2015, upon completion, it was uploaded to Post's SoundCloud account. On July 19, 2015, Malone released a music video for \"White Iverson\", which has received over 205 million views since its release. After the initial hype of \"White Iverson\", Post released several other popular singles through his SoundCloud, including \"Too Young\", \"What's Up\" and \"Tear$\". All of which experienced similar levels of popularity. After hitting one million views within a month of releasing \"White Iverson\", Post quickly garnered attention from record labels. In August 2015, he signed a recording contract with Republic Records.\n\nSince his breakthrough hit song, Malone has worked with a number of prominent rappers such as 50 Cent, Young Thug and Kanye West, among others. Malone began his friendship with Canadian singer and songwriter Justin Bieber, which led to Malone to be a opening act for Bieber's Purpose World Tour. On April 20, 2016, Malone premiered his new single, \"Go Flex\" on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show. On May 12, 2016, he released his first full-length project, a mixtape, titled August 26th. On June 9, 2016, Malone made his national television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, performing \"Go Flex\". In June 2016, XXL editor-in chief Vanessa Satten, revealed Post Malone was considered for XXL's \"2016 Freshmen Class\" magazine cover, however she was \"told by his camp that he wasn't paying attention to hip hop so much. He was going in more of a rock/pop/country direction.\" However, Malone denied these claims, saying: \"My love of music should never be questioned... I shouldn't be chastised in whichever way I see fit.\" He then went on to explain that his latest mixtape as well as his upcoming album are both hip-hop: \"I have a hip-hop album coming out in August... I made a HIP HOP mixtape promoting my HIP HOP album.\"\n\nThe title of his debut mixtape August 26th was a reference to the scheduled release date of his debut studio album Stoney. On August 27, 2016, Post Malone issued an apology for the album being late. It was available for pre-order on November 4.",

Prince was renowned as an innovator and was widely known for his eclectic work, flamboyant stage presence, and wide vocal range. He was widely regarded as the pioneer of Minneapolis sound. His music combined rock, R&B, soul, funk, hip hop, disco, psychedelia, jazz, and pop.\n\nPrince was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and developed an interest in music at an early age, writing his first song at age seven. After recording songs with his cousin's band 94 East, 19-year-old Prince recorded several unsuccessful demo tapes before releasing his debut album For You in 1978, under the guidance of manager Owen Husney. His 1979 album Prince went platinum due to the success of the singles \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\". His next three records—Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982)—continued his success, showcasing Prince's trademark of prominently sexual lyrics and incorporation of elements of funk, dance, and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released Purple Rain, which served as the soundtrack to his film debut of the same name. A prolific songwriter, Prince in the 1980s wrote songs for and produced work by many other acts, often under pseudonyms.\n\nAfter releasing the albums Around the World in a Day (1985) and Parade (1986), The Revolution disbanded and Prince released the critically acclaimed double album Sign \"O\" the Times (1987) as a solo artist. He released three more solo albums before debuting The New Power Generation band in 1991. He changed his stage name in 1993 to an unpronounceable symbol, also known as the \"Love Symbol\". He then began releasing new albums at a faster pace to remove himself from contractual obligations to Warner Bros.; he released five records between 1994 and 1996 before signing with Arista Records in 1998. In 2000, he began referring to himself as \"Prince\" again.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Albert Johnson (born November 2, 1974), better known by his stage name Prodigy, is an American rapper and one half of the Hip-hop duo Mobb Deep with Havoc. He is the great-great-grandson of the founder of Morehouse College.\n\nBorn in Hempstead, New York, Prodigy became a member of the duo Mobb Deep. He comes from a musical family—his grandfather, Budd Johnson, and his great-uncle Keg Johnson are remembered for their contributions to the Bebop era of jazz. His mother, Fatima Frances Collins, was a member of The Crystals. Propelled to awareness partially by fellow rapper Nas, who took a similar approach lyrically on his Illmatic album from 1994, as well as with the aid of a successful single, \"Shook Ones Pt. 2,\" Mobb Deep released The Infamous. A year later, in 1996, Prodigy and Havoc released Hell on Earth; debuting at number six on SoundScan the album was composed with both evocative beats and cinematic rhymes that communicated the dark side of New York's urban landscape. Due to a grim video for \"Hell on Earth (Front Lines)\" and theatrical Scarface-like photos inside the CD booklet picturing the duo with guns and a mound of cocaine, Mobb Deep had created an elaborate image for themselves that took hardcore gangsta rap to a new level for East Coast hip hop. Its next release, Murda Muzik, was heavily bootlegged while still in its demo stage, leaking, onto the streets and over the internet, rough versions of the nearly 30 songs the duo had recorded.\n\nHe started work on his third solo album H.N.I.C. Part 2, which was previewed on his official mixtape The Return of the Mac on the independent label Koch Records. The mixtape single and mixtape video are called \"Mac 10 Handle,\". H.N.I.C. Pt. 2 was released through Voxonic Inc., of which Prodigy is an equity holder. In late 2009, Mobb Deep was released from its contract with 50 Cent's G-Unit label. He recently served a three-year sentence in Mid-State medium-security prison, following a plea agreement stemming from a gun-possession charge. He was officially released on March 7, 2011.\n\nProdigy released an autobiography during spring 2011 entitled My Infamous Life: The Autobiography of Mobb Deep’s Prodigy. It was co-written with Laura Checkoway and was published by Touchstone Books. Prodigy was recently featured in the 2011 documentary Rhyme and Punishment a film that documents Hip-Hop artists who have been incarcerated. The film documents Prodigy's trial and his last days before starting his prison sentence. During 2011, Prodigy released a free EP called The Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson EP which is his first project since being released from prison. On April 21, a song titled \"The Type\", with Curren$y, was released on Curren$y's free album, entitled Covert Coup. Prodigy has spoken out against the secret society Illuminati. In 2013, Prodigy released his second collaboration album with The Alchemist titled Albert Einstein. Then on April 1, 2014, Mobb Deep released The Infamous Mobb Deep their eighth studio album.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Public Enemy is an American hip hop group consisting of Chuck D, Flavor Flav, Professor Griff and his S1W group, DJ Lord (DJ who replaced Terminator X in 1999), and Music Director Khari Wynn. Formed in Long Island, New York, in 1982, Public Enemy is known for their politically charged lyrics and criticism of the American media, with an active interest in the frustrations and concerns of the African American community.\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Public Enemy number forty-four on its list of the Immortals: 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Acclaimed Music ranks them the 29th most recommended musical act of all time and the highest hip-hop group. The group was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2007.\nDeveloping his talents as an MC with Flavor Flav while delivering furniture for his father's business, Chuck D (Carlton Douglas Ridenhour) and Spectrum City, as the group was called, released the record \"Check Out the Radio,\" backed by \"Lies,\" a social commentary-both of which would influence RUSH Productions' Run-D.M.C. and Beastie Boys.\nChuck D put out a tape to promote WBAU (the radio station where he was working at the time) and to fend off a local MC who wanted to battle him. He called the tape Public Enemy #1 because he felt like he was being persecuted by people in the local scene. This was the first reference to the notion of a public enemy in any of Chuck D's songs. The single was created by Chuck D with a contribution by Flavor Flav, though this was before the group Public Enemy was officially assembled.\nAround 1986, Bill Stephney, the former Program Director at WBAU, was approached by Sam the Assassin and offered a position with the label. Stephney accepted, and his first assignment was to help fledgling producer Rick Rubin sign Chuck D, whose song \"Public Enemy Number One\" Rubin had heard from Andre \"Doctor Dré\" Brown. According to the book The History of Rap Music by Cookie Lommel, \"Stephney thought it was time to mesh the hard-hitting style of Run DMC with politics that addressed black youth. Chuck recruited Spectrum City, which included Hank Shocklee, his brother Keith Shocklee, and Eric \"Vietnam\" Sadler, collectively known as the Bomb Squad, to be his production team and added another Spectrum City partner, Professor Griff, to become the group's Minister of Information. With the addition of Flavor Flav and another local mobile DJ named Terminator X, the group Public Enemy was born.\"\nAccording to Chuck, The S1W, which stands for Security of the First World, \"represents that the black man can be just as intelligent as he is strong. It stands for the fact that we're not third-world people, we're first-world people; we're the original people .\"\nPublic Enemy started out as opening acts for the Beastie Boys during the latter's Licensed to Ill popularity, and in 1987 released their debut album Yo! Bum Rush The Show\nOver the next few years, Public Enemy released It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, Fear of a Black Planet, and Apocalypse 91â€¦ The Enemy Strikes Black. In addition to ushering in the golden age of hip hop, during this time, Public Enemy reached the height of their popularity, adulation, and controversy. The group then separated from Def Jam and has since been independently producing, marketing, and publishing their music.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Kamaal Ibn John Fareed, better known by his stage name Q-Tip, is an American hip hop recording artist from St. Albans, Queens, New York, part of the critically acclaimed group A Tribe Called Quest. John Bush of Allmusic called him \"the best rapper/producer in hip-hop history,\" while editors of About.com placed him on their list of the Top 50 Hip-Hop Producers, as well as placing him on their list of the Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987–2007). In 2012, The Source ranked him #20 on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time.\nBorn Jonathan Davis on April 10, 1970 in Harlem, he converted to Islam in the mid-1990s, and changed his name to Kamaal Ibn John Fareed. He moved to St. Albans, Queens as a child. As referenced in the song \"Check the Rhime\", he mostly resided at Linden Boulevard. His father was from Montserrat, a British territory in the eastern Caribbean. His mother is an African-American from Alabama. His sister, Gwen, is eight years older than he is. He attended Murry Bergtraum High School in Manhattan, New York. According to Fareed, he was given his stage name by Afrika Baby Bam of Jungle Brothers, which he used as a replacement for his prior name, MC Love Child. He has also said that the Q in Q-Tip stands for Queens and he is often referred to as Tip, which later caused problems when a Southern rapper, now known as T.I., signed to Arista Records and attempted to use the stage name Tip, which was later shortened to T.I. to avoid confusion with his then-labelmate Q-Tip. Throughout his career, he also called himself \"The Abstract\". He said that one of the main people in his life that inspired him was his childhood friend, Mohammed Sead.\nQ-Tip lives in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. He is the cousin of Consequence, who was featured heavily on Beats, Rhymes, and Life. According to a DNA analysis, he descended, mainly, from the Jola people of Guinea Bissau.\nQ-Tip is a founding member of the critically acclaimed hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest, in 1985, together with his high school friends Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Jarobi White. The band signed to Jive Records and released five studio albums during its initial run. The band split up in 1998. A Tribe Called Quest reunited in 2006 and played a limited number of dates. The group was composed of its original lineup, including Q-Tip and occasional member Jarobi.\nQ-Tip provided the rap element of the highly successful 1990 track \"Groove Is in the Heart\" performed by Deee-Lite, rapped on the 1994 Beastie Boys track \"Get It Together\", and on the 2005 Chemical Brothers track \"Galvanize\".\n\nAfter the breakup of the group, Q-Tip pursued a solo career. His first solo singles, \"Vivrant Thing\" and \"Breathe & Stop\", were far more pop-oriented than anything he had done in A Tribe Called Quest, as was his solo debut LP for Arista Records, Amplified. His 2002 follow-up, Kamaal/The Abstract, although critically acclaimed and issued a catalog number, wasn't released at that time because the label believed that it did not have commercial appeal. Q-Tip featured on R.E.M.'s 2004 album Around the Sun during this period, with a rap on \"The Outsiders\".\n\nEarly 2007, Q-Tip signed a new solo deal with Motown/Universal Records.\n\nIn 2008, Q-Tip appeared on DJ/producer Statik Selektah's first album Spell My Name Right, on the tracks \"Stop, Look, & Listen\" with Styles P and Termanology.\n\nHis latest album The Renaissance was released on November 4, 2008, through Universal Motown and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 2010 Grammys.\nKamaal/The Abstract was finally released on September 15, 2009, on Battery Records after being shelved for seven years.\n\nQ-Tip is among a group of producers who were brought in by Kanye West to work on his fifth album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. He appeared in 2010 on Mark Ronson's album, Record Collection, on the song entitled \"Bang Bang Bang\" with MNDR, for which a video was released.\n\nFor Kanye West's and Jay-Z's collaborative album Watch The Throne he produced \"That's My Bitch\" and co-produced \"Lift Off\".\n\nQ-Tip was the headliner at the 2011 Brooklyn Hip Hop Festival with a set called, 'Q-Tip and Friends'. Accompanying him on stage were Monie Love, Black Thought, Busta Rhymes, and Kanye West.\nQ-Tip produced the first three A Tribe Called Quest albums almost entirely by himself, with the exception of contributions from Skeff Anselm (\"Eight Million Stories\", \"Everything Is Fair\") and Large Professor (\"Keep It Rolling\"). Q-Tip did production work as part of the production company The Ummah, alongside fellow Tribe member Ali Shaheed Muhammad and the late Slum Village member J Dilla. Outside of his work with Tribe, Q-Tip produced for such artists as Apache (\"Gangsta Bitch\", 1993), Nas (\"One Love\", from Illmatic, 1994), Mobb Deep (\"Give up the Goods (Just Step)\", \"Temperature's Rising\", and \"Drink Away the Pain\", from The Infamous, 1995) and R&B singers Mariah Carey (\"Honey\", from Butterfly, 1997) and Whitney Houston (\"Fine\", from Whitney: The Greatest Hits). He co-wrote and featured in Janet Jackson's song \"Got 'til It's Gone\" from the album The Velvet Rope in 1997. He co-produced jazz guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel's 2003 release Heartcore. He is/has been involved with producing for Esperanza Spalding, Mary J. Blige, RZA, Wale, Asher Roth, Chiddy Bang, Melanie Fiona, Mark Ronson, Busta Rhymes, Beyoncé, Phife Dawg, D'Angelo, Questlove, Kanye West, Roc Marciano, and Jay-Z.\nOn March 18, 2013, Q-Tip was a Special Guest of Honor for the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding at the home of Def Jam Records Founder, Russell Simmons, who serves as Chairman of The Foundation. Q-Tip was invited by friend Ali Naqvi, who is a Trustee of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding and Chairman of MindShare Ventures Group in New York City. Q-Tip received this invitation to be Special Guest of Honor, for being one of the most successful Muslim music artists and producers in the world.\nFareed regularly acts as a DJ, most notably at Santos Party House where he hosted a weekly residency called OPEN.\nAt Paper magazine's 2008 Nightlife Awards, OPEN was named \"Best DJ Night\"",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1971, originally consisting of Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), John Deacon (bass guitar, guitars, vocals), and Roger Taylor (drums, vocals). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works, incorporating more diverse and innovative styles in their music.\nBefore joining Queen, Brian May and Roger Taylor had been playing together in a band named Smile with bassist Tim Staffell. Freddie Mercury (then known as Farrokh/Freddie Bulsara) was a fan of Smile, and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques after Staffell's departure in 1970. Mercury himself joined the band shortly thereafter, changed the name of the band to \"Queen\", and adopted his familiar stage name. John Deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album (1973). \nQueen enjoyed success in the UK with their debut and its follow-up, Queen II (1974), but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack (1974) and A Night at the Opera (1975) that gained the band international success. The latter featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which stayed at number one in the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks; it charted at number one in several other territories, and gave the band their first top ten hit on the US Billboard Hot 100. Their 1977 album, News of the World, contained two of rock's most recognisable anthems, \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\". By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world, and their performance at 1985's Live Aid is regarded as one of the greatest in rock history. In 1991, Mercury died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS, and Deacon retired in 1997. Since then, May and Taylor have infrequently performed together, including a collaboration with Paul Rodgers under the name Queen + Paul Rodgers which ended in May 2009.\nThe band has released a total of 18 number one albums, 18 number one singles, and 10 number one DVDs. Estimates of their album sales generally range from 150 million to 300 million albums, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. They received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1990, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Famed rapper, singer, model and actress Dana Elaine Owens, better known by her stage name Queen Latifah, was born on March 18, 1970, in Newark, New Jersey. Her debut album All Hail to the Queen sold more than 1 million copies, and the single U.N.I.T.Y. earned Latifah her first Grammy Award. Latifah has also garnered acclaim for acting; she earned her first Oscar nomination (best supporting actress) for her performance in the blockbuster musical Chicago. She has also earned a Golden Globe award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, two Image Awards, six additional Grammy nominations, an Emmy Award nomination and an Academy Award nomination.  Latifah was born and raised in the public housing projects of Newark, New Jersey, the daughter of Rita, a schoolteacher who worked at Irvington High School, and Lancelot Owens, a policeman. Her parents divorced when Latifah was ten. Latifah performed the number \"Home\" from the musical The Wiz in a high school play. Her stage name, Latifah (لطيفة), meaning \"kind\" in Arabic, was given to her when she was eight by her cousin. Latifah was raised in the Baptist church, and, while in high school, was a power forward on her basketball team.  She started her career beatboxing for the rap group Ladies Fresh. Latifah was one of the members of the original version of the Flavor Unit MC's, which, at that time, was a crew of MC's grouped around producer DJ Mark The 45 King. In 1988, DJ Mark the 45 King heard a demo version of Latifah's single Princess of the Posse and gave the demo to Fab 5 Freddy, who was the host of Yo! MTV Raps. The recording captured the attention of Tommy Boy Music employee Dante Ross, who immediately signed Latifah, and in 1988 issued her first single, Wrath of My Madness. The track met with a positive response and afforded her the opportunity to launch a European tour, and to perform at the Harlem's famed Apollo Theater. The next year Latifah released her first album, All Hail the Queen, which went on to sell more than 1 million copies.  As she began to earn money, Latifah displayed an interest in investment, putting money into a delicatessen and a video store on the ground floor of the apartment in which she was living. She came to realize that she had a knack for business, and realized that there was an opening for her in record production. In 1991, Latifah organized and became chief executive officer of the Flavor Unit Records and Management Company, headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey. In the same year she was released her sophomore album, called Nature of a Sista'. It was the final album on Tommy Boy Records. By late 1993, the company had signed 17 rap groups, including the very successful Naughty By Nature. In 1993, Latifah recorded a jazz- and reggae-influenced album titled Black Reign. While the album sold more than 500,000 copies, the single U.N.I.T.Y. earned Latifah her first Grammy Award in 1995. In 1998, Co Produced by Ro Smith now CEO of Def Ro Inc. she released her fourth hip hop album Order in the Court. After Order in the Court, Latifah shifted primarily to sung lyrics in soul music and jazz standards, which she had used sparingly in her previous hip hop-oriented records.  In 2004, she released the soul/jazz standards The Dana Owens Album. On July 11, 2007, Latifah sang at the famed Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles as the headlining act in a live jazz concert. Before a crowd of more than 12,400, she was backed by a 10-piece live orchestra and three backup vocalists, The Queen Latifah Orchestra. Latifah performed new arrangements of standards including California Dreaming, first made popular by '60s icons The Mamas & the Papas. In 2007, Latifah released an album entitled Trav'lin' Light. Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, Joe Sample, George Duke, Christian McBride, and Stevie Wonder made guest appearances. It was nominated for a Grammy in the \"Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album\" category. On September 12, 2008, Rolling Stone reported that Queen Latifah is working on a new album that is due in sometime in 2009; this album will be, at least partially, produced by Dr. Dre. She will also work with Missy Elliott.   Acting Success  In the 1990s, Latifah branched out into acting. She made her big screen debut in Spike Lee's interracial romance drama Jungle Fever (1991). The following year, Latifah appeared in the crime thriller Juice with Omar Epps and Tupac Shakur. She soon landed a leading role on the small screen, appearing in the sitcom Living Single from 1993 to '98. The comedy, which also starred Kim Coles, Kim Fields and Erika Alexander, proved to be a ground-breaking show. It remains one of the few sitcoms to focus on a group of African-American women.  A talented performer, Latifah continued to tackle both comedic and dramatic parts. She co-starred in 1996's Set It Off with Jada Pinkett Smith, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox, playing as a lesbian bank robber. Two years later, Latifah teamed up with Holly Hunter and Danny DeVito for the comedy Living Out Loud (1998). She also appeared with Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie in The Bone Collector (1999).  Perhaps Latifah's most acclaimed film role to date came in the 2002 hit musical Chicago, starring Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger. Her portrayal of prison matron Mama Morton gave her a chance to show off both her singing talents and acting skills. For her work in the film, Latifah earned an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress. She lost to Chicago co-star Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Latifah went on to receive strong reviews for 2003's romantic comedy Bringing Down the House co-starring with Steve Martin. The following year, she experienced some disappointment with Taxi, which co-starred Jimmy Fallon. The comedy proved to be a critical and commercial dud. She fared better with Beauty Shop (2005) and her voice-over work in the hit animated film Ice Age: The Meltdown (2006).  In 2007, Queen Latifah again delighted movie-goers with her musical talents. She appeared as Motormouth Maybelle in Hairspray with John Travolta. Her crime caper Mad Money (2008) with Diane Keaton and Katie Holmes received much colder reception. Returning to drama, Latifah gave a strong performance in The Secret Life of Bees (2008).  On the small screen, Latifah has made a number of guest television appearances over the years, including on the shows 30 Rock and Single Ladies. She also co-starred in the 2012 TV remake of Steel Magnolias with Alfre Woodard, Phylicia Rashad and Jill Scott. Latifah branched out in a new direction the following year. She will enter the daytime television market with a new talk show. The Queen Latifah Show will debut in the fall of 2013. The program promises to be a mix of interviews and comedic and musical performances, according to BET.com.  In addition to acting, Queen Latifah serves as a spokesperson for CoverGirl cosmetics. She even has her own line with the company: The Queen Collection.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Queens of the Stone Age is an American rock band from Palm Desert, California, United States, formed in 1997. The band's line-up includes founding member Josh Homme (lead vocals, guitar), alongside longtime members Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, backing vocals), Joey Castillo (drums, percussion), and Michael Shuman (bass guitar, backing vocals), who were joined by Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, lap steel) in 2007.\n\nFormed after the dissolution of Homme's previous band, Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age developed a style of riff-oriented, heavy rock music. Their sound has since evolved to incorporate a variety of different styles and influences, including working with ZZ Top member Billy Gibbons and steady contributor Mark Lanegan, both of whom have contributed from genres such as blues and grunge respectively.\n\nThe band's first release was Gamma Ray, a two-track EP featuring the songs \"Born to Hula\" and \"If Only Everything\" (which would later appear on their self titled debut as 'If Only'), released in January 1996, featuring Joshua Homme (Kyuss), Matt Cameron (Soundgarden and Pearl Jam), Van Conner (Screaming Trees) and John McBain (Monster Magnet). The band's first live appearance was probably November 20, 1997, at OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington. In December of the same year, the band released a split EP, Kyuss/Queens of the Stone Age, which was the first official release by the band under the name Queens of the Stone Age, and featured three tracks from the Gamma Ray sessions as well as three Kyuss tracks recorded in 1995 just prior to their break-up. The band released their self-titled debut, Queens of the Stone Age (1998) on Loose Groove records (the album was also released on vinyl by Man's Ruin Records), which was recorded with Homme handling both guitar- and bass guitar-playing duties (though basswork is credited to Homme's alter-ego, Carlo Von Sexron), Alfredo Hernández on the drums, and included several other instrumental and vocal contributions by Chris Goss and Hutch. Homme reportedly asked Screaming Trees' vocalist Mark Lanegan to appear on the record, but he was unable to due to other commitments. Soon after the recording sessions were finished for the album, former Kyuss bassist Nick Oliveri joined and touring commenced. Consisting entirely of ex-Kyuss members, this is widely regarded as QOTSA's original lineup. Guitarist Dave Catching joined shortly after. A recording of a phone message which plays the voice of Oliveri stating his decision to join the band can be heard at the end of the album's final song, \"I Was a Teenage Hand Model\". From this point forward, the band's line-up would change frequently. By the time their second album was being recorded, Hernández was no longer in the band.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Queensrÿche is an American progressive heavy metal band formed in 1981 in Bellevue, Washington. The band has released eleven studio albums and several EPs and DVDs and continues to tour and record.\n\nQueensrÿche has been successful in the progressive scene, having sold over 20 million albums worldwide including over 6 million albums in the United States.\n\nThe foundations for Queensrÿche began in the early 1980s. Guitarist Michael Wilton and drummer Scott Rockenfield were members of a band called Cross+Fire, who covered songs from popular heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. Before long Cross+Fire added guitarist Chris DeGarmo and bassist Eddie Jackson to their lineup, and changed their name to The Mob. The Mob, who were without a singer, recruited Geoff Tate to sing for them at a local rock festival. At the time, Tate was already in a band called Babylon. After Babylon broke up Tate performed a few shows with The Mob, but left because he was not interested in performing heavy metal.\n\nIn 1981, The Mob put together sufficient funds to record a demo tape. Once again, Tate was enlisted to help. The group recorded four songs - \"Queen of the Reich,\" \"Nightrider,\" \"Blinded\" and \"The Lady Wore Black.\" The group brought their demo to various labels and were rejected by all of them. Tate also was still committed to staying in his then-current band, Myth.\n\nAt the urging of their new manager, The Mob changed their name to Queensrÿche. The name is derived from the title track of their demo, \"Queen of the Reich\", and is the only known use of the letter Y with an umlaut in English. It was a modification of the spelling \"Queensreich\" to prevent association of the band with Nazism. As they later joked: \"The umlaut over the 'y' has haunted us for years. We spent eleven years trying to explain how to pronounce it.\"",

One of the first popular alternative rock bands, R.E.M. gained early attention due to Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style and Stipe's unclear vocals. R.E.M. released its first single, \"Radio Free Europe\", in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \"The One I Love\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\nBy the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre and released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. R.E.M. disbanded in September 2011, announcing the split on its website.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Radiohead are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), Colin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion) and Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals).\nRadiohead released their debut single \"Creep\" in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer is often acclaimed as one of the landmark records of the 1990s.\nKid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked an evolution in Radiohead's musical style, as the group incorporated experimental electronic music, krautrock and jazz influences. Kid A, though somewhat polarizing at the time of its release, is now frequently recognized as one of the most important albums of the 2000s. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of piano and guitar driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by war, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a digital download for which customers could set their own price, and later in physical form to critical and chart success. Radiohead's eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures, which the band released independently.\nRadiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, with the band's work being placed highly in both listener polls and critics' lists, they have the distinction of doing so in both the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, Radiohead were ranked number 73 in Rolling Stone's list of \"The Greatest Artists of All Time\", while Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and Thom Yorke in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Rage Against the Machine (also known as RATM or just Rage) is an American political rap metal band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1991, the group consists of rapper and vocalist Zack de la Rocha, bassist and backing vocalist Tim Commerford, guitarist Tom Morello and drummer Brad Wilk. They draw inspiration from early heavy metal instrumentation, as well as hip hop acts such as Afrika Bambaataa, Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys and Dutch crossover band Urban Dance Squad. Rage Against the Machine is well known for the members' leftist and revolutionary political views, which are expressed in many of the band's songs. As of 2010, they have sold over 16 million records worldwide.\nIn 1992, the band released its self-titled debut album, which became a commercial and critical success, leading to a slot in the 1993 Lollapalooza festival. In 2003, the album was ranked number 368 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The band did not release a follow-up record until 1996, with Evil Empire. The band's third album, The Battle of Los Angeles, followed in 1999, and in 2003, the album was ranked number 426 on the same list. During their initial nine-year run, they became one of the most popular and influential bands in music history, according to music journalist Colin Devenish. They were also ranked No. 33 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band had a large influence on the nu metal genre which came to prominence during the second half of the 1990s.\nIn 2000, the band released the cover album, Renegades. The same year, growing tensions over the direction of the band prompted de la Rocha to quit, leading to the band's breakup. De la Rocha started a low-key solo career, while the rest of the band formed the rock supergroup Audioslave with Chris Cornell, then-former frontman of Soundgarden; Audioslave recorded three albums before disbanding in 2007. The same year, Rage Against the Machine announced a reunion and performed together for the first time in seven years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2007. Up until 2011, the band continued to perform at more live venues and festivals around the world. As of 2016, the group has no plans to perform or release new music.",

They were originally established with Ronnie James Dio's American rock band Elf, but after the first album, Blackmore fired the backing members and continued with Dio until 1979. Three British musicians joined in 1979, singer Graham Bonnet, keyboardist Don Airey, former Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover, and this line-up gave the band their commercial breakthrough with the single \"Since You Been Gone\". Over the years Rainbow went through many line-up changes with no two studio albums featuring the same line-up. Other lead singers Joe Lynn Turner and Doogie White would follow, and the project consisted of numerous backing musicians. The band's early work primarily featured mystical lyrics with a neoclassical metal style, but went in a more streamlined, commercial direction following Dio's departure from the group.\n\nRainbow were ranked No. 90 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

Despite achieving only limited commercial success, the band was a major influence on the punk rock movement both in the United States and the United Kingdom.\nAll of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname \"Ramone\", though none of them were related. They performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years. In 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, the band played a farewell concert and disbanded. Little more than eight years after the breakup, the band's three founding members-lead singer Joey Ramone, guitarist Johnny Ramone, and bassist Dee Dee Ramone-had died.\nTheir only record with enough U.S. sales to be certified gold was the compilation album Ramones Mania. However, recognition of the band's importance built over the years, and they are now cited in many assessments of all-time great rock music, such as the Rolling Stone list of the 50 Greatest Artists of All Time and VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. In 2002, the Ramones were ranked the second-greatest band of all time by Spin magazine, trailing only The Beatles. On March 18, 2002, the Ramones-including the three founders and drummers Tommy and Marky Ramone-were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2011, the group was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Throwback R&B singer Raphael Saadiq was born in Oakland, CA, in 1966, and started playing music six years later. He played bass at church and school and enjoyed his place on-stage at various local hometown events. After high school, Saadiq won a chance to join Prince and Sheila E. on the Parade tour. Such an experience inspired Saadiq to make music his life, and before the '80s came to an end, he formed Tony! Toni! Tone!.\n\nSaadiq went under his birth name of Wiggins while in Tony! Toni! Tone!, and was joined by his brother, Dwayne Wiggins, and cousin Timothy Christian. Tony! Toni! Tone! made their debut with \"Little Walter\" in 1988. Two years later, they were mega-stars thanks to the success of their second album, The Revival. The ballad \"It Never Rains (In Southern California)\" and the club-friendly \"Feels Good\" were major hits and the band eventually sold six million albums. However, Saadiq left the group at the height of its fame.\n\nA solo career was in the works by the time the mid-'90s rolled around. Two singles for movie soundtracks -- 1995's \"Ask of You\" from Higher Learning and \"Me & You\" from Boyz N da Hood -- were Saadiq's proper solo introduction, but not exactly satisfying. He was used to being part of a band, so a solo career made him a bit apprehensive. Saadiq bowed out for some normalcy over the next few years.\n\nLucy Pearl was Saadiq's next project, where he joined with En Vogue's Dawn Robinson and Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest for a short-lived super-group. Saadiq also had his hand in producing material for the likes of Macy Gray, TLC, the Roots, and D'Angelo. In 2000, his song \"Untitled\" won D'Angelo a Grammy. Inspired by his new \"gospedelic\" approach, he captured a new sound for himself while recording material between Oakland and Sacramento. The end result was Instant Vintage, which earned five Grammy nominations in 2003. The blaxploitation era-referencing Ray Ray and the '60s-flavored The Way I See It followed, respectively, in 2004 and 2008; the latter was nominated for three Grammys. Stone Rollin' was released in 2011, just after Saadiq and his band of the same name backed Mick Jagger for a Grammy Awards perfomance of Solomon Burke's \"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love.\" The album maintained Saadiq's streak of throwback-oriented releases.

He was a pioneer in the genre of soul music during the 1950s by fusing rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues styles into his early recordings with Atlantic Records. He also helped racially integrate country and pop music during the 1960s with his crossover success on ABC Records, most notably with his Modern Sounds albums. While with ABC, Charles became one of the first African-American musicians to be given artistic control by a mainstream record company. Frank Sinatra called Charles \"the only true genius in show business\".\n\nThe influences upon his music were mainly jazz, blues, rhythm and blues and country artists of the day such as Art Tatum, Nat King Cole, Louis Jordan, Charles Brown, Louis Armstrong. His playing reflected influences from country blues and barrelhouse, and stride piano styles.\nRolling Stone ranked Charles number ten on their list of \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" in 2004, and number two on their November 2008 list of \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\". In honoring Charles, Billy Joel noted: \"This may sound like sacrilege, but I think Ray Charles was more important than Elvis Presley. I don't know if Ray was the architect of rock & roll, but he was certainly the first guy to do a lot of things . . . Who the hell ever put so many styles together and made it work?\"",

Lillywhite soon left the project, but Razorlight continued to write and record the album while still wowing audiences with a spate of live dates, including a strong showing at the 2004 South by Southwest industry fest.\n\nAt this point, drummer Smith-Pancorvo left the group and was soon replaced by Andy Burrows. Thus reconfigured, Razorlight made their official album debut in August 2004 with Up All Night. The release was hailed for its stylish, fizzy mix of Strokes-styled sensibilities and post-Brit-pop cool. Additional show dates opening for the likes of Queen (with vocalist Paul Rodgers) and Oasis gave Razorlight some of their biggest audiences in 2005, adding to the bandmates' growing popularity in their native U.K. The band's second offering, a self-titled effort produced by Chris Thomas, arrived in summer 2006 and yielded Razorlight's first chart-topping single, \"America.\" The album itself also topped the U.K. charts, going multi-platinum in the process, and Razorlight maintained their presence on British radio throughout 2007 before embracing a slick, mainstream pop/rock style on 2008's Slipway Fires.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Red Hot Chili Peppers, also sometimes shortened to \"The Chili Peppers\" or abbreviated as \"RHCP\", are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, their music incorporates elements of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals), Flea (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith; and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late-2009, replacing John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards and have become one of the best-selling bands of all time, selling over 80 million records worldwide. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nThe band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea. Because of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's self-titled debut album (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on the second and third albums by the band Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987), but he died from a heroin overdose in 1988. As a result of his friend's death, Irons chose to depart from the group as drummer. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak, though his tenure was short, which forced Frusciante to replace him in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons. His tenure was also short, so he was replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante, and Smith was the longest-lasting and recorded five studio albums beginning with Mother's Milk (1989). In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991) under producer Rick Rubin. This album became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the Blood Sugar Sex Magik Tour.\nAfter two temporary guitarists, Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction joined for the group's subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro was fired from the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 16 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number-one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band in 2009 to focus on his solo career. Klinghoffer who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, replaced him as lead guitarist. The band's tenth studio album, I'm with You, was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries. The group toured into 2014 and performed with Bruno Mars as a part of the halftime performance at Super Bowl XLVIII. The band is currently recording their eleventh studio album, expected to be released in 2016.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Robin Gibb CBE (born Robin Hugh Gibb on Isle of Man, United Kingdom on 22 December 1949 - 20 May 2012) was a British singer and songwriter. He is best known as a member of the Bee Gees (1958-2003 & 2009-2012), co-founded with his twin brother Maurice Gibb (1949-2003) and older brother Barry Gibb. Their younger brother, Andy Gibb (1958-1988) was also, in his time, a popular solo singer.  Born in the Isle of Man to English parents, the family later moved to Manchester before settling in Brisbane, Australia. Gibb began his career as part of the family trio and when the group found their first success they returned to the United Kingdom where they achieved worldwide fame. In 2004, the Bee Gees received their CBEs from the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace for their \"contribution to music\". With record sales estimated in excess of 200 million units, the Bee Gees became one of the most successful pop groups of all time.  After a career spanning six decades, Gibb last performed on stage in February 2012 supporting injured British servicemen and women at a charity concert at the London Palladium. On 20 May 2012, Gibb died after a lengthy battle with colorectal cancer.  Solo career Traditionally, Robin's role in the group has been one of singer, for which he vied constantly with his elder brother Barry Gibb during the group's first period of British success in the late 1960s. This eventually resulted in Robin leaving the group to begin a solo career. Meanwhile, there were rumours of drug problems, and his parents threatened to have him made a ward of court (the UK age of consent at that time being 21, and Robin only 19). Although initially successful, with a number 2 hit, Saved by the Bell, his album, \"Robin's Reign\", was less successful and he found that being a solo artist was less than satisfying. He returned to the group and mended the breach with his family. During the 1980s, he released three further solo albums (\"How Old Are You\", \"Secret Agent\", and \"Walls Have Eyes\") which were more successful in Continental Europe than in the UK or USA. However, his 1984 single \"Boys Do Fall in Love\" did reach the Billboard top 40 Robin's next solo album, Magnet, was released in Germany on January 27, 2003 (Label: SPV), and worldwide shortly afterwards. It features the old Bee Gees classic Wish You Were Here in a new acoustic version.  In August 2003, Robin announced that he would be releasing a new single of My Lover's Prayer, a song first recorded by the Bee Gees in 1997, with vocals by Robin, Wanya Morris, and Lance Bass. This was played on radio, but was never actually released. In October 2003 another version was recorded as a duet with Alistair Griffin, runner-up in the UK television program Fame Academy, on which Robin had appeared as a judge.  My Lover's Prayer, credited as \"Alistair Griffin feat. Robin Gibb\", was eventually released in the UK in January 2004 as a double A side single, together with Griffin's solo recording of Bring It On. It reached number 5 in the UK charts. The duet was also on Griffin's debut album Bring It On which charted at number 12.  In late 2004, Robin embarked on a solo tour of Germany, Russia and Asia, with Alistair Griffin as the opening act. On his return he released a CD and DVD of live recordings from the German leg of the tour, backed by the Frankfurt Neue Philharmonic Orchestra. A further solo tour of Latin America followed in 2005.  In June 2005 he joined X Factor runners up G4 at a sell-out concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London, singing the Bee Gees song First of May . A recording of this performance was released in December 2005 as part of a double A side single, credited as \"G4 feat. Robin Gibb\" together with G4's own cover of Johnny Mathis' When a Child is Born. This track was also included on the platinum selling album G4 & Friends which reached number 6 in the UK album charts.  In March 2006 he announced plans for more solo concerts in Shanghai and Portugal. On May 20th. 2006, Robin took part in the Prince's Trust 30th Birthday Concert at the Tower of London along with his brother Barry. They sang 3 songs; Jive Talkin', To Love Somebody and You Should be Dancing.",

By the age of seven, Ronald was singing on-stage at venues such as the Regal Theater in Chicago, alongside Dinah Washington and a few other notables.\n\nBy his early teens, he was singing regularly with his brothers in church tours and also first appeared on TV on Ted Mack's Amateur Hour. In 1957, sixteen-year-old Ronald and his two elder brothers Kelly, 19 and Rudy, 18, moved to New York, recording doo-wop for local labels before landing a major deal with RCA Records in 1959, where the trio wrote and released their anthemic \"Shout.\" By the summer of 1959, the Isley family had moved from Cincinnati to a home in Englewood, New Jersey.\n\nFor much of the Isley Brothers' duration, Ron Isley would remain the group's consistent member of the group as well as the lead vocalist for most of the group's tenure with sporadic lead shares with his older brothers.

In 1973, the group's style and sound drastically changed following the release of the 3 + 3 album where brothers Ernie Isley and Marvin Isley and in-law Chris Jasper permanently enter the brothers' lineup, writing the music and lyrics to the group's new sound.

In 1990, Isley scored a top-ten duet with Rod Stewart with a cover of his brothers' hit \"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You),\" and in 2003 Ronald recorded a solo album, Here I Am: Bacharach Meets Isley, with Burt Bacharach.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Ronnie James Dio (born Ronald James Padavona, July 10, 1942 - May 16, 2010) was an Italian American heavy metal vocalist and songwriter. He fronted numerous groups including Elf, Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Heaven & Hell, and his own band, Dio. He is credited with popularizing the \"metal horns\" hand gesture in metal culture and is known for his medieval themed lyrics. Dio possessed a powerful versatile vocal range capable of singing both hard rock and lighter ballads and according to Rainbow/Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore upon hearing him sing, \"I felt shivers down my spine.\" Dio sold over 47 million albums throughout his career. \n\nEarly years, education and musical training:\nRonnie James Dio was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to Italian American parents who had moved to Portsmouth from Cortland, New York, where they had grown up. The family resided in Portsmouth for only a short time before Dio's parents returned to Cortland. Dio listened to a great deal of opera while growing up, and was influenced vocally by American tenor Mario Lanza. His first and only formal musical training began at age 5 learning to play the trumpet. During high school, Dio played in the school band and was one of the youngest members selected to play in the school's official Dance Band. It was also during high school that Dio formed his first rock-n-roll group, the Vegas Kings (the name would soon change to Ronnie and the Rumblers, and then Ronnie and the Red Caps). Though Dio began his rock-n-roll career on trumpet, he quickly added bass guitar to his skillset once he assumed singing duties for the group. \nDio graduated from Cortland High School in 1960. Though he claimed in a later interview to have been offered a scholarship to the prestigious Juilliard School of Music, he did not pursue it due to his continuing interest in rock-n-roll music. Instead, after graduation, he attended the University at Buffalo, majoring in Pharmacology. He only attended from 1960 to 1961, and played trumpet in the university's concert band, and did not graduate. \nDespite being known for his powerful singing voice, Dio claimed never to have taken any vocal training. Rather, he attributed his singing ability to the use of correct breathing techniques learned while playing trumpet. \n\nCareer:\n\nEarly career:\nDio's musical career began in 1957 when several Cortland, New York musicians formed the band, The Vegas Kings. The group's lineup consisted of Dio on bass guitar, Billy DeWolfe on lead vocals, Nick Pantas on guitar, Tom Rogers on drums, and Jack Musci on saxophone. \nIn 1958, the band again changed their name from Ronnie & The Rumblers to Ronnie and the Redcaps. Musci left the band in 1960, and a new guitarist, Dick Botoff, joined the lineup. The Redcaps released two singles: The first single was \"Conquest\"/\"Lover\" with the A-side being an instrumental reminiscent of The Ventures and the B-side featuring DeWolfe on lead vocals. The second single was \"An Angel Is Missing\"/\"What'd I Say\" which featured Dio on lead vocals for both tracks. \nExplanations vary for how Padavona adopted the stage name \"Dio\". One story is that Dio was a reference to mafia member Johnny Dio. Another has it that Padavona's grandmother said he had a gift from God and should be called \"Dio\". Whatever the inspiration, Padavona first used it on a recording in 1960, when he added it to the band's second release on Seneca. Soon after that the band modified their name to Ronnie Dio and the Prophets. The Prophets lineup lasted for several years, touring throughout the New York region and playing college fraternity parties. They produced one single for Atlantic and one album. Some of the singles (such as \"Mr. Misery\", released on Swan) were labeled as being by Ronnie Dio as a solo artist even if the rest of the Prophets contributed to the recording. The group released several singles during the following years, until early 1967. Dio continued to use his birth name on any songwriting credits on those releases. \nIn late 1967 Ronnie Dio and the Prophets transformed into a new band called The Electric Elves and added a keyboard player. Following recovery from a deadly car accident in February 1968 (which killed guitarist Nick Pantas and put Dio and other band members in the hospital briefly), the group shortened its name to The Elves and used that name until mid 1972 when it released its first proper album under the name Elf. Over the next few years, the group went on to become a regular opening act for Deep Purple. Elf recorded three albums until the members' involvement recording the first Rainbow album in early 1975 resulted in Elf disbanding. \n\nRainbow:\n\nDio's vocals caught the ear of Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore in the mid-1970s, who was planning on leaving then due to creative differences over the band's new direction. Blackmore invited Dio along with Gary Driscoll to record two songs in Tampa, Florida on December 12, 1974. Blackmore stated in 1983 that \"I left Deep Purple because I'd met up with Ronnie Dio, and he was so easy to work with. He was originally just going to do one track of a solo LP, but we ended up doing the whole LP in three weeks, which I was very excited about.\"  Being satisfied with the results, Blackmore decided to recruit more of Elf's musicians and form his own band, primarily known as Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow. They released the self-entitled debut album Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow in early 1975. After that, Dio recorded two studio albums (Rising and Long Live Rock 'n' Roll) and one live album (On Stage) with Blackmore. During his tenure with Rainbow, Dio and Blackmore were the only constant members. Dio is credited on those albums for all lyrical authorship as well as collaboration with Blackmore on musical arrangement. Dio and Blackmore split with Blackmore taking the band in a more commercial direction, with Graham Bonnet on vocals and the album \"Down to Earth\". \n\nBlack Sabbath:\nDio left Rainbow in 1979 and soon joined Black Sabbath, replacing the fired Ozzy Osbourne. Dio met Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi by chance at The Rainbow on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles in 1979. Both men were in similar situations, as Dio was seeking a new project and Iommi required a vocalist. Dio said of the encounter, \"It must have been fate, because we connected so instantly.\" The pair kept in touch via telephone, until Dio arrived at Iommi's Los Angeles house for a relaxed, getting-to-know-you jam session. On that first day the duo wrote the song \"Children Of The Sea\" which would appear on the Heaven and Hell album, the first the band recorded with Dio as vocalist in 1980. \nThe follow-up album, Mob Rules, featured new drummer Vinny Appice. Personality conflicts began emerging within the band. \"Ronnie came into the band and he was doing whatever we told him, basically because he wanted the gig. The next album was a little different,\" Iommi recalled. In 1982, conflict arose over the mixing of the Live Evil album. Iommi asserted that the album's engineer began complaining to him that he would work all day long on a mix, only to have Dio return to the studio at night to \"do his own mix\" in which his vocals were more prominent. This was denied by Dio. The conflict led to Dio and Appice ultimately quitting the band later that year. \nIn 1992, Dio briefly returned to Black Sabbath to record the Dehumanizer album. The album was a minor hit, reaching the Top 40 in the United Kingdom and #44 on the Billboard 200. The single \"Time Machine\" was featured in the movie Wayne's World, the tenth highest-grossing film of 1992. Soon Dio and Appice again left the band, citing an inability to work with Iommi and Butler. \n\nDio:\nWanting to continue together as a band, Ronnie James Dio and Vinnie Appice formed Dio, the band, in 1982. On guitar played Vivian Campbell and on bass Jimmy Bain, the latter whom he had known since the old Rainbow days. Their debut album, Holy Diver, included the hit singles \"Rainbow in the Dark\" and the title track, \"Holy Diver\". That lineup recorded three albums, before the band changed members over the years and leaving Dio as the only original member. Except a few breaks, Dio, the band, was always touring or recording. They released ten albums, with Master of the Moon being the last one, recorded in 2004. \n\nHeaven & Hell:\n\nIn October 2006, it was confirmed that Dio would be joining Black Sabbath members Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and former Black Sabbath drummer Vinny Appice to tour under the moniker Heaven & Hell, the title of the first Dio era Black Sabbath album. They chose the name Heaven & Hell as Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler were still in Black Sabbath with Ozzy Osbourne and felt it was best to use a different moniker for the Dio version of the band. Original Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward was to be involved in this project, but he later withdrew. \nIn 2007, the band recorded three new songs under the Black Sabbath name for the compilation album Black Sabbath: The Dio Years. \nIn 2008, the band completed a 98-date world tour. The band released one album under the Heaven & Hell name, The Devil You Know, to critical and commercial acclaim. They also had planned to release a follow-up in 2010. \n\nOther projects:\nIn 1974, Dio sang on the Roger Glover conducted and produced concept album The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast. Along with other guest-singers, the album featured Deep Purple alumni Glenn Hughes and David Coverdale. Dio provided vocals for the songs \"Homeward\", \"Sitting in a Dream\", and the UK single \"Love is All\". \nIn 1980, Dio sang the tracks \"To Live for the King\" and \"Mask of the Great Deceiver\" on Kerry Livgren's solo album, Seeds of Change. Dio, who was between stints as singer for Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow and Black Sabbath, later proved somewhat controversial among Livgren's Christian fans, as Black Sabbath and Dio were then perceived as \"satanic\" by many Christians. Dio said in an interview that he did not consider the album to be a \"Christian\" album and had performed on it as a favor to Livgren. \nIn 1985, Dio contributed to the metal world's answer to Band Aid and USA for Africa with the Hear 'n Aid project. With a heavy metal all-star ensemble which was the brainchild of his fellow Dio band mates Vivian Campbell and Jimmy Bain, he sang some of the vocals on the single \"Stars\" and an album full of songs from other artists given to charity. \nThe project raised $1 million within a year. \nIn 1997, Dio made a cameo on Pat Boone's In a Metal Mood: No More Mr. Nice Guy, an album of famous heavy metal songs played in big band style. Dio can be heard singing backup on Boone's take of \"Holy Diver\". In 1999, he was parodied in the TV show South Park, in the episode Hooked on Monkey Fonics, which he later went on to describe as \"wonderful\". \nIn 1999, Dio participated in a significant Deep Purple project, Concerto for Group and Orchestra, where he recorded cover versions of Deep Purple songs, and reprised his songs from the earlier The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast album. \nTenacious D included a tribute song entitled \"Dio\" that appeared on their self-titled album. The song explains how he has to \"pass the torch\" for a new generation. Reportedly, Dio approved of it, and had Tenacious D appear in his video \"Push\" from Killing the Dragon in 2002. He also appeared in the film Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, playing himself. \nIn 2005, Dio was revealed to be the voice behind Dr. X in Operation: Mindcrime II, the sequel to Queensrÿche's seminal concept album Operation: Mindcrime. His part was shown in a prerecorded video on the subsequent tour, and Ronnie appeared onstage to sing the part live on at least one occasion (both shown on the Mindcrime at the Moore DVD). \nOn January 17, 2007, he was inducted into the Rock Walk of Fame at Guitar Center on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard. \nDio is thanked in the end credits of the 2011 film Atlas Shrugged: Part I, due to his being \"one of the people who kept the project alive.\" \n\nPersonal life:\n\nDio and his first wife, Loretta Berardi (born 1941), adopted a son, novelist Dan Padavona. \nAfter divorcing Berardi, he married Wendy Gaxiola (born 1945) who also served as his manager. In the 1980s, she managed the Los Angeles rock bands Rough Cutt, and Hellion. Dio remained married to Gaxiola until his death. \n\nIllness and death:\nOn November 25, 2009, Wendy announced that Dio had been diagnosed with stomach cancer and was being treated at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, but that he would be back on stage when recovered. \nOn May 4, 2010, Heaven & Hell announced they were canceling all summer dates as a result of Dio's ill health. His last live performance was with Heaven & Hell on August 29, 2009, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. \n\nDio died at 7:45 am (CDT) on May 16, 2010, of metastasized stomach cancer, according to official sources. \nA public memorial service was held on May 30, 2010 at The Hall Of Liberty, Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles. The hall was filled to capacity, with more fans sitting outside the hall watching from a screen. Friends, family, and former and current band mates of Dio gave speeches and performed including Rudy Sarzo, Geoff Tate, John Payne, Glenn Hughes, Joey Belladonna, and Heaven & Hell keyboard player, Scott Warren. On the screen was an accompanying documentary covering Dio's career from his early days with Elf to his final project with Heaven & Hell. \n\nLegacy:\n\nDio's career spanned over fifty years. During this period, and particularly in the 21st century, he received a number of distinctions and awards. He was inducted into the Cortland City Hall of Fame in 2004, and has a street named after him there called Dio Way. Classic Rock Magazine awarded Dio with the \"Metal Guru Award\" at their yearly \"Roll Of Honour\" awards ceremony in 2006. On January 17, 2007, Dio was inducted into Guitar Center's Rock Walk of Fame in Hollywood, California. Dio was named \"Best Metal Singer\" at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards in April 2010 for his work on The Devil You Know, making him the oldest recipient of this award at age 67. He accepted the award in person at what was to be his final public appearance, less than one month before his death. The main stage of Bloodstock Open Air is also named after him in tribute after Heaven & Hell pulled out upon his death. Also the main stage on Masters of Rock festival carries his name since summer 2010. A Dio monument has been unveiled in Kavarna, Bulgaria. In Mexico the biggest metal fest was named \"Hell and Heaven\" in honor of Dio; the organization says that the festival was named that way since they had worked with Dio, referring to him as \"the greatest singer and person we ever had worked with, a really humble person\" \nRolling Stone magazine eulogized Dio with these words: \"It wasn't just his mighty pipes that made him Ronnie James Dio -- it was his moral fervor...what always stood out was Dio's raging compassion for the lost rock & roll children in his audience. Dio never pretended to be one of the kids -- he sang as an adult assuring us that we weren't alone in our suffering, and some day we might even be proud of conquering it\". \nOn July 10, 2011, in parallel to Dio's birthday, his home town of Cortland, New York, held a day-long event featuring many central New York local bands and talent for a benefit to the Stand Up and Shout Cancer foundation for cancer research and Dio Memorial concert. Part of the proceeds from the event went to fund a memorial music scholarship for the local city high-school in his name. \nOn March 31, 2014, the tribute album Ronnie James Dio This Is Your Life was released. It was organized and produced by Wendy Gaxiola, with album proceeds benefitting the Ronnie James Dio Stand Up and Shout Cancer Fund. \nDio Brando from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a reference/homage to the singer. \n\nBand timeline:\nThe Vegas Kings (1957-1958), \nRonnie & The Rumblers (1958), \nRonnie & The Red Caps (1958-1961), \nRonnie Dio & The Prophets (1961-1967), \nThe Electric Elves (1967-1969), \nThe Elves (1969-1970), \nElf (1970-1975), \nRainbow (1975-1979), \nBlack Sabbath (1979-1982, 1991-1992, 2007), \nDio (1982-1991, 1993-2010), \nHear 'n Aid (1985), \nHeaven & Hell (2006-2010)",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Roxy Music are an English art rock band formed in 1971 by Bryan Ferry, who became the group's lead vocalist and chief songwriter, and bassist Graham Simpson. The other members are Phil Manzanera (guitar), Andy Mackay (saxophone and oboe) and Paul Thompson (drums and percussion). Former members include Brian Eno (synthesiser and \"treatments\"), and Eddie Jobson (synthesiser and violin). Although the band took a break from group activities in 1976 and again in 1983, they reunited for a concert tour in 2001, and have toured together intermittently since that time.\nRoxy Music attained popular and critical success in Europe and Australia during the 1970s and early 1980s, beginning with their debut album, Roxy Music (1972). The band were highly influential, as leading proponents of the more experimental, musically sophisticated element of glam, as well as a significant influence on early English punk music. They also provided a model for many New Wave acts and the experimental electronic groups of the early 1980s. The group is distinguished by their visual and musical sophistication and their preoccupation with style and glamour. Ferry and co-founding member Eno have also had influential solo careers, the latter becoming one of the most significant record producers and collaborators of the late 20th century. Rolling Stone magazine ranked Roxy Music No. 98 on its \"The Immortals – 100 The Greatest Artists of All Time\" list.\nTheir music was influenced by other British artists of the time such as Ferry's favourite band The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, The Who, The Pretty Things, Pink Floyd, The Creation, The Move, Traffic, David Bowie, King Crimson, and Elton John. Eno's \"treatments\" were influenced by the experimental sound of The Velvet Underground.\nIn 2005 they began recording a new studio album, which would have been their ninth. It would have been Roxy's first record since 1973 with Brian Eno, who wrote two songs for it as well as played keyboards. However, Bryan Ferry eventually confirmed that material from these sessions would be released as a Ferry solo album, with Eno playing on \"a couple of tracks,\" and that he doesn't think they'll record as Roxy Music again. Subsequently, this was confirmed by the announcement of a solo Bryan Ferry album, titled Olympia.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Roy Kelton Orbison (April 23, 1936 - December 6, 1988) was an American singer-songwriter, best known for his distinctive, powerful voice, complex compositions, and dark emotional ballads. Orbison grew up in Texas and began singing in a rockabilly/country and western band in high school until he was signed by Sun Records in Memphis. His greatest success came with Monument Records between 1960 and 1964, when 22 of his songs placed on the Billboard Top Forty, including \"Only the Lonely\", \"Crying\", and \"Oh, Pretty Woman\". His career stagnated through the 1970s, but several covers of his songs and the use of \"In Dreams\" in David Lynch's Blue Velvet revived his career in the 1980s. In 1988, he joined the supergroup Traveling Wilburys with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne and also released a new solo album. He died of a heart attack in December that year, at the zenith of his resurgence. His life was marred by tragedy, including the death of his first wife and his two eldest sons in separate accidents.\nOrbison was a natural baritone, but music scholars have suggested that he had a three- or four-octave range. The combination of Orbison's powerful, impassioned voice and complex musical arrangements led many critics to refer to his music as operatic, giving him the sobriquet \"the Caruso of Rock\". Elvis Presley and Bono have stated his voice was, respectively, the greatest and most distinctive they had ever heard. While most men in rock and roll in the 1950s and 1960s portrayed a defiant masculinity, many of Orbison's songs instead conveyed a quiet, desperate vulnerability. He was known for performing while standing still and solitary, wearing black clothes and dark sunglasses which lent an air of mystery to his persona.\nOrbison was initiated into the second class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 by longtime admirer Bruce Springsteen. The same year he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame two years later. Rolling Stone placed Orbison at number 37 on their list of The Greatest Artists of All Time, and number 13 on their list of The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. In 2002, Billboard magazine listed Orbison at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists.",

The group is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential acts in the history of hip hop culture.\nRun-D.M.C. were one of the most well-known hip hop acts in the 1980s who, along with LL Cool J, signified the advent of the new school of hip hop music. They were the first group in the genre to have a gold album (Run-D.M.C., 1984) and be nominated for a Grammy Award. They were the first to earn a platinum record (King of Rock, 1985), the first to earn a multi-platinum certification (Raising Hell, 1986) the first to have videos on MTV, the first to appear on American Bandstand and the cover of Rolling Stone. The group was among the first to highlight the importance of the MC and DJ relationship. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked them number 48 in their list of the greatest musical artists of all time.\nIn 2007, Run-D.M.C. was named \"The Greatest Hip Hop Group of All Time\" by MTV.com and \"Greatest Hip Hop Artist of All Time\" by VH1. On April 4, 2009, rapper Eminem inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In doing so, Run-D.M.C. became only the second hip hop group in history to be inducted, after Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.\nThe initials \"D.M.C.\" are widely accepted to refer to Darryl McDaniels' initials. In the 1985 album King of Rock's title track, McDaniels says the initials have two meanings: \"Devastating Mic Control\" and \"D for never dirty, MC for mostly clean.\" He also makes a third reference \"The 'D's for Doing it all of the time, the 'M's for the rhymes that all are Mine, The 'C's for Cool - cool as can be.\"",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Rush is a Canadian rock band formed in August 1968, in the Willowdale neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario. The band is composed of bassist, keyboardist, and lead vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist and backing vocalist Alex Lifeson, and drummer, percussionist and lyricist Neil Peart. The band and its membership went through a number of re-configurations between 1968 and 1974, achieving their current form when Peart replaced original drummer John Rutsey in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first United States tour. Rutsey's departure stemmed primarily from health concerns regarding his diabetes.\n\nSince the release of the band's self-titled debut album in March 1974, Rush has become known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy. Rush's music style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired heavy metal on their first album, then encompassing hard rock, progressive rock, and a period with heavy use of synthesizers. They have been cited as an influence by various musical artists, including Metallica, Primus, and The Smashing Pumpkins,as well as progressive metal bands such as Dream Theater and Symphony X.\n\nRush has won a number of Juno Awards, and was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994. Over their careers, the members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each band member winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls. As a group, Rush possesses 24 gold records and 14 platinum (3 multi-platinum) records. Rush's sales statistics place them third behind The Beatles and The Rolling Stones for the most consecutive gold or platinum studio albums by a rock band. Rush also ranks 79th in U.S. album sales, with 25 million units. Although total worldwide album sales are not calculated by any single entity, as of 2004 several industry sources estimated Rush's total worldwide album sales at over 40 million units.\n\nThe band finished the second leg of the Time Machine Tour in July 2011 and released their latest studio album, Clockwork Angels in June 2012 with a supporting tour in the fall.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Solána Imani Rowe (born November 8, 1990), known professionally by SZA (/ˈsɪzə/; short for either \"Sovereign Zig-Zag Allah\" or \"Savior Zig-Zag Allah\"), is an American R&B singer and songwriter. She was born in St. Louis, Missouri, later relocating to Maplewood, New Jersey. In October 2012, Rowe self-released her debut EP, See.SZA.Run, which she then followed up with her second EP, titled S, in April 2013. In July 2013, it was revealed that she had signed to the hip hop record label Top Dawg Entertainment, through which she released Z, her third EP and first retail release, in April 2014.\n\nSZA's debut studio album, Ctrl, was released on June 9, 2017, to universal acclaim from music critics. The album debuted at number three on the US Billboard Top 200 and spawned the platinum-certified singles \"The Weekend\" and \"Love Galore\", which features rapper Travis Scott. Ctrl received several Grammy Award nominations, including Best Urban Contemporary Album.\n\nSZA is a neo soul singer whose music has been described as alternative R&B, with elements of soul, hip hop, minimalist R&B, cloud rap, witch house and chillwave. Rowe's lyrics are described as \"unravelling\", that revolve around themes of sexuality, nostalgia, and abandonment. SZA cites a variety of artists as influences, including Ella Fitzgerald, Meelah, Björk, Jamiroquai, and Lauryn Hill, among others. SZA also takes influence from non-musical artists, including filmmaker Spike Lee.\n\nEarly life\nSZA was born on November 8, 1990, in St. Louis, Missouri, before later relocating to Maplewood, New Jersey, where she was raised. Her father was an executive producer at CNN, while her mother was an executive at AT&T. Rowe was born to a Christian mother and a Muslim father. She was raised as an \"Orthodox Muslim\" and has an older half-sister TIffany Daniels. She attended a \"Muslim Prep-School\" everyday after her \"Regular School\". Rowe attended Columbia High School, where she was very active in sports, including gymnastics and cheerleading.  However, due to the September 11 attacks, Rowe was subjected to bullying, leading her to stop wearing her hijab. SZA continues to practice Islam. As a high school sophomore, she was ranked among the best gymnasts in the United States.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Rowe later went to Essex County College to study liberal arts. She eventually dropped out and took random jobs in order to make money. Rowe formed her stage name from the Supreme Alphabet, taking influence from rapper RZA, the last two letters in her name stand for Zig-Zag and Allah, while the first letter Rowe says can mean either savior or sovereign.\n\nSZA vocal style has been described as taking on the \"lilt\" of a jazz singer. According to Marissa G. Muller of Rolling Stone magazine, Rowe's vocals alternate between a \"vapory husk and a sky-high falsetto\". Jordan Sargent of Pitchfork magazine labelled Rowe's vocals as being \"chillwave\" and \"ethereal\". SZA disputes her music being labelled as hip-hop, R&B and pop, stating she often listens to a variety of music including Stevie Nicks, classical jazz, folk, and rap. Further, she said: \"when you try to label it , you remove the option for it to be limitless. It diminishes the music.”\n\nSZA musical style has been described as \"alt R&B\". SZA songs are built over \"layers of sliced, delayed, and reversed vocals\" and contains \"twists and mutates\". Reggie Ugwu from Billboard magazine finds her musical style to feature an \"agnostic utopia dripping with mood\", that straddles the \"line between minimalist R&B, '80s synth pop and soul\". Rowe's music is primarily PBR&B and neo-soul, but has been noted for taking influences from a broad variety of genres including soul, hip hop, minimalist R&B, cloud rap, ethereal R&B, witch house and chillwave elements. Michael Madden described SZA's musical genre as being \"agnosticism corresponds\", noting that her work is not just one style of music and is versatile, noting the musical style is not just \"R&B, pop, soul, or one thing at all\".\n\nSZA began writing songs due to being \"passionate\" about writing, and enjoyed poetry; when writing lyrics, SZA \"freestyles\" them in order to express whatever comes to her \"mind\", noting that it does not always make sense to herself. Thematically, SZA's work contains \"unravelling lyrics\", that touch upon themes of sexuality, nostalgia, and abandonment.\n\nInfluences\nSZA listens to Ella Fitzgerald for vocal influence, and has said that Lauryn Hill is one of her personal influences. SZA also cites a wide range of musical artists as influences, including Meelah, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, LFO, Macy Gray, Common, Björk, Jamiroquai, and \"a lot of Wu, Nas, Mos Def, Hov\". Speaking on her influences, SZA said:\n\n personal influences came from dancing with American Ballet Theatre and doing pieces to Björk . That's the only time I had really any outside influence to music. So, the people that I fell in love with on a musical level were always much older. Jamiroquai is just, like, the shit for me\", whom she also grew up listening too.\n\nDuring an interview, SZA said she is less inspired by strictly music, and more inspired by creating art in general; she has looked up to people who were not \"typical artists\" including her \"favorite gymnast, ice-skater, saxophonist, painter, or movie director,\" continuing to say she was particularly inspired by film director Spike Lee. During an interview with W, SZA spoke on her style influences, saying a large amount of her style inspiration comes from movies, including Wes Anderson films, praising his use of \"pantone color palette\" and that she \"would love to dress like a character from Moonrise Kingdom. Or perhaps Bill Murray in The Life Aquatic.\"\n\nPublic image\nSZA, her music, and her image have been compared to neo-soul artists Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill. SZA's hair became a point of interest during the early stages of her career and she discussed it in interviews with Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. During her performances, SZA tends to wear \"free-flowing\" clothes that are easy to move around in and has also been known to wear pajamas or baggy clothing onstage. SZA is known as TDE's first female signee and first singer, which also drew attention during the early stages of her career; Rowe described this attention as \"uncomfortable.\"",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Sade (pronounced “shah-day”) is a Grammy-winning British smooth jazz band named after their lead singer Sade Adu. The band’s music features elements of jazz, funk, soul and rnb.\n\nSade was formed in 1982, when members of a Latino-soul band Pride — Sade Adu, (real name Helen Folasade Adu - born 16 January 1959 in Ibadan, Nigeria) Stuart Matthewman and Paul Spencer Denman — together with Paul Cook formed a splinter group and began to write their own material. Sade made their debut in December 1982 at Ronnie Scott’s Club in London, England, in support of Pride. Later, in 1983, Andrew Hale joined Sade. In 1984 Paul Cook left the band.\n\nSade Adu, the band’s singer, is the daughter of a Nigerian father and an English mother. After her mother returned to England, Sade grew up on the North End of London. Developing a good singing voice in her teens, Sade worked part-time jobs in and outside of the music business. She listened to Ray Charles, Nina Simone, Al Green, Aretha Franklin, and Billie Holliday. Sade studied fashion design at St. Martin’s School of Art in London while also doing some modeling on the side.\n\nAround 1980, Adu started singing harmony with a latin funk group called Arriva. One of the more popular numbers that the group would perform was a Sade original co-written with bandmember Ray St. John, “Smooth Operator,” that would later become Sade’s first stateside hit. The following year Adu joined the eight-piece funk band Pride as a background singer. The band included future Sade band members guitarist/saxophonist Stuart Matthewman (a key player in ’90s urban soul singer Maxwell’s success) and bassist Paul Denman. The concept of the group was that there could shoot-offs. In essence, a few members within the main group Pride formed mini-groups that would be the opening act. Pride did a lot of shows around London, stirring up record company interest. Initially, the labels wanted to only sign Adu, while the group members wanted a deal for the whole band. After a year, the other band members told Adu, Matthewman, and Denman to go ahead and sign a deal. Adding keyboardist Andrew Hale, the group signed to the U.K. division of Epic Records.\n\nIn May 1983, Sade performed at Danceteria Club in New York, NY, United States. It was the first US Sade show. They received more attention from the media and record companies and separated finally. On 18 October 1983 Sade Adu signed with Epic Records. The rest of the band signed in 1984. All Sade albums were released through this label.\n\nTheir debut album, Diamond Life (with overall production by Robin Millar), went Top Ten in the U.K. in late 1984. January 1985 saw the album released on CBS’ Portrait label and by spring it went platinum off the strength of the Top Ten singles “Smooth Operator” and “Hang on to Your Love.” The second album, Promise (November 1985), featured “Never As Good As the First Time” and arguably her signature song, “The Sweetest Taboo,” which stayed on the U.S. pop charts for six months. Sade was so popular that some radio stations reinstated the ’70s practice of playing album tracks, adding “Is It a Crime” and “Tar Baby” to their play lists. In 1986, Sade won a Grammy for Best New Artist.\n\nSade’s third album was 1988’s Stronger Than Pride and featured their first number one soul single “Paradise,” “Nothing Can Come Between Us,” and “Keep Looking.” A new Sade album didn’t appear for four years. 1992’s Love Deluxe continued the unbroken streak of multi-platinum Sade albums, spinning off the hits “No Ordinary Love,” “Feel No Pain,” and “Pearls.” While the album’s producer Mike Pela, Matthewman, Denman, and Hale have gone on to other projects. The new millennium did spark a new scene for Sade. She issued Lovers Rock in fall 2000 and incoporated more mainstream elements than ever before. Debut single “By Your Side” was also a hit among radio and adult-contemporary listerners. The following summer, Sade embarked on their first tour in more than a decade, selling out countless dates across America. In early 2002, Sade celebrated their success of the tour by releasing their first ever live album and DVD, Lovers Live.\n\nSade made a great contribution to development of modern music. They dismantled many of the old music business ways and quite promptly became a fully functioning autonomous unit with a firm grip on every aspect of the recording process.\n\nSade is first and foremost a live act. Sade Adu said in one of her interviews: “When we play I know that the people love the music. I can feel it.” Throughout their history, Sade have always attracted a diverse, multi-racial audience who are drawn by the band’s open-minded approach to music. “And that’s the best thing we’ve achieved.”",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Samuel Cook (January 22, 1931 – December 11, 1964), known professionally as Sam Cooke, was an American singer, songwriter, and entrepreneur.\nInfluential as both a singer and composer, he is commonly known as the King of Soul for his distinctive vocals and importance within popular music. His pioneering contributions to soul music contributed to the rise of Aretha Franklin, Bobby Womack, Al Green, Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Billy Preston, and popularized the likes of Otis Redding and James Brown. AllMusic biographer Bruce Eder wrote that Cooke was \"the inventor of soul music\", and possessed \"an incredible natural singing voice and a smooth, effortless delivery that has never been surpassed\".\nCooke had 30 U.S. top 40 hits between 1957 and 1964, plus three more posthumously. Major hits like \"You Send Me\", \"A Change Is Gonna Come\", \"Cupid\", \"Chain Gang\", \"Wonderful World\", and \"Twistin' the Night Away\" are some of his most popular songs. Cooke was also among the first modern black performers and composers to attend to the business side of his musical career. He founded both a record label and a publishing company as an extension of his careers as a singer and composer. He also took an active part in the civil rights movement.\nOn December 11, 1964, at the age of 33, Cooke was shot and killed by Bertha Franklin, the manager of the Hacienda Motel in Los Angeles, California. After an inquest, the courts ruled Cooke's death to be a justifiable homicide. Since that time, the circumstances of his death have been called into question by Cooke's family and his wide circle of friends and acquaintances.",

In 1954, he lost his left eye in an automobile accident, and several years later, he converted to Judaism.\n\nDavis's film career began as a child in 1933. In 1960, he appeared in the first Rat Pack film, Ocean's 11. After a starring role on Broadway in 1956's Mr Wonderful, Davis returned to the stage in 1964's Golden Boy, and in 1966 had his own TV variety show, The Sammy Davis Jr. Show. Davis's career slowed in the late 1960s, but he had a hit record with \"The Candy Man\" in 1972 and became a star in Las Vegas, earning him the nickname \"Mister Show Business\".\n\nAs an African-American, Davis was the victim of racism throughout his life and was a large financial supporter of the Civil Rights movement. Davis had a complex relationship with the African-American community, and drew criticism after physically embracing President Richard M. Nixon in 1972. One day on a golf course with Jack Benny, he was asked what his handicap was. \"Handicap?\" he asked. \"Talk about handicap — I'm a one-eyed Negro Jew.\" This was to become a signature comment, recounted in his autobiography, and in countless articles.\n\nAfter reuniting with Sinatra and Dean Martin in 1987, Davis toured with them and Liza Minnelli internationally, before he died of throat cancer in 1990. He died in debt to the Internal Revenue Service, and his estate was the subject of legal battles.\n\nDavis was awarded the Spingarn Medal by the NAACP and was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award for his television performances. He was the recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 1987, and in 2001, he was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Santo & Johnny were an American rock and roll duo from Brooklyn, New York.\n\nThey are best known for their instrumental “Sleep Walk”, which became a regional hit and eventually reached the top of the Billboard pop chart when it was released nationally in 1959.\nAt present, Santo is semi-retired and Johnny tours and records new material with his own band. Johnny is also the president of Aniraf, Inc., an international record company based in New York.\n\nSanto and Johnny Farina were born in Brooklyn, New York; Santo on October 24, 1937 and Johnny on April 30, 1941. Their father was drafted into the Army while they were children and was stationed for some time in Oklahoma. After hearing a steel guitar on the radio, he wrote to his wife, “I’d like the boys to learn to play this instrument”.\nUpon returning from World War II, the boys’ father found a music teacher who gave the boys steel guitar lessons. When Santo was a teenager, he was able to get a local music store to modify an acoustic guitar, allowing him to play it like a steel guitar.\nWithin two years, Santo was performing in amateur shows on a new Gibson six-string steel guitar and had started receiving lessons from a steel guitar teacher who had studied in Hawaii. By the age of fourteen, Santo was composing songs, and formed an instrumental trio with a guitarist and drummer. This trio appeared at local dances and parties, performing both original compositions and some Hawaiian standards. With money Santo made from these performances, he bought a Fender steel guitar, one with three necks, each with eight strings. This allowed him to experiment even further, and he tried different tunings until he found ones that appealed to him.\nWhen Johnny reached the age of twelve, he began to play accompaniment to Santo on a standard electric guitar. The brothers soon formed a duo and became rather popular in school, eventually performing at events in the New York boroughs. They recorded a demo which they circulated to local New York record companies.\nIn 1958, Mike Dee & The Mello Tones (Santo Farina, steel guitar; Johnny Farina, guitar and their uncle Mike Dee, drums) recorded a self-penned instrumental which they called “Deep Sleep”. Loosely inspired by the song “Softly, As In The Morning Sunrise” (Sigmund Romberg, 1929), it had the same chord progression but a simpler melody line.\n“Deep Sleep” became “Sleep Walk” and in September 1959 it topped the American charts.\n\nThe brothers eventually came to the attention of a music publishing company and signed a song writer’s contract and eventually a contract with Canadian-American Records. Their first release, “Sleep Walk”, was composed by the two brothers. (The original single credits three Farinas, including an “A. Farina” for the composition. It’s sometimes reported that their mother or sister helped, but this is apparently false.) It was recorded at Trinity Records in Manhattan. “Sleep Walk” entered Billboard’s ‘Top 40’ on August 17, 1959. It rose to the No. 1 position for two weeks in September (the 21st and the 28th) and remained in the ‘Top 40’ list until November 9. It was the last instrumental to hit #1 in the 1950s and earned Santo & Johnny a gold record. The follow-up song “Tear Drop” was also a hit, though their LP Santo & Johnny was less successful in the United States.\nAfter touring Europe, Mexico, and Australia, Santo & Johnny signed to an Italian record label and had several hits in Europe that included “Sleep Walk”, “Love Story”, “Maria Elena”, “Ebb Tide”, “Love is Blue”, “Enchanted Sea”, and others. In 1964, they released an album of The Beatles covers; “And I Love Her” hit #1 in Mexico and held the spot for 21 weeks. In 1973, Santo & Johnny recorded the theme to the movie The Godfather, which went to #1 in Italy and stayed at that spot for 21 weeks. They received a gold record in Italy and were inducted into the Italian Music Hall of Fame.\n\nJohnny Farina currently operates the official Santo And Johnny worldwide website, which includes current tour dates, discography, biography, trivia and new merchandise Farina also currently operates the official Johnny MySpace page, which includes current tour dates, discography, biography, and audio samples from his new solo albums.\n\n“Sleep Walk” continues to be popular due to consistent radio airplay as well as its usage in commercials, television shows, and movies. One of the first covers was by Betsy Brye (stage name of Bette Anne Steele) in 1959. While Santo & Johnny wrote lyrics for “Sleep Walk”, they never recorded a lyrical version, but Betsy Brye’s version included these lyrics. It has been also covered by The Shadows, Stray Cats, The Ventures, Jake Shimabukuro, Amos Garrett, Kenny Vance and the Planotones, Larry Carlton, Deftones, Chet Atkins, Danny Gatton, Leo Kottke, The Sir Douglas Quintet, Jonathan Richman, Larry Berwald, and Joe Satriani. Indie group Modest Mouse also covered the song with lyrics and entitled their version “Sleepwalkin’”. A version by Brian Setzer received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance of 1998. “Sleep Walk” was used throughout the 1992 Stephen King film, Sleepwalkers. “Sleep Walk” also plays a role in the 1995 Terry Gilliam sci-fi film, 12 Monkeys. It is also played in the end scene of “La Bamba” after protagonist Ritchie Valens dies. The song can also be heard in “Eddie and the Cruisers” as well as in the film “Hearts in Atlantis” starring Anthony Hopkins. Tim Kring’s ‘Heroes’ which aired on NBC also featured “Sleep Walk” playing on a record in a diner, from the episode ‘1961’.\nSanto & Johnny were inducted into The Steel Guitar Hall of Fame in 2002.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Scorpions are a hard rock and heavy metal band from Hannover, Germany formed in 1965 by guitarist Rudolf Schenker, who is the band's only constant member (although Klaus Meine has been lead singer for all their studio albums). They are known for their 1980s rock anthem \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" and many singles, such as \"No One Like You\", \"Send Me an Angel\", \"Still Loving You\", and \"Wind of Change\". The band was ranked No. 46 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock program. \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" is also No. 18 on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs. On January 24, 2010, after 45 years of performing, the band announced that they would be retiring after touring in support of their new album Sting in the Tail, although this decision was eventually retracted. The band sold over 100 million albums worldwide.\nRudolf Schenker, the band's rhythm guitarist launched the band in 1965. At first, the band had beat influences and Schenker himself did the vocals. Things began to come together in 1970 when Schenker's younger brother Michael and vocalist Klaus Meine joined the band. In 1972 the group recorded and released their debut album Lonesome Crow, with Lothar Heimberg on bass and Wolfgang Dziony on drums. During the Lonesome Crow tour, Scorpions opened for upcoming British band UFO. Near the end of the tour, the members of UFO offered guitarist Michael Schenker the lead guitar job, an offer which he soon accepted. Uli Roth, a friend of the Schenker brothers, was then called in temporarily to finish off the tour.\nThe departure of Michael Schenker led to the breakup of the band. In 1973, Uli Roth, who had helped Scorpions complete the Lonesome Crow tour, was offered the role as lead guitarist, but turned the band down, preferring instead to remain in the band Dawn Road. Rudolf Schenker eventually decided that he wanted to work with Roth, but did not want to resurrect the last Scorpions lineup. He attended some of Dawn Road's rehearsals and ultimately decided to join the band, which consisted of Roth, Francis Buchholz (bass), Achim Kirschning (keyboards) and JÃ¼rgen Rosenthal (drums). Roth and Buchholz persuaded Rudolf Schenker to invite Klaus Meine to join on vocals, which he soon did. While there were more members of Dawn Road than Scorpions in the band, they decided to use the Scorpions name because it was well known in the German hard rock scene and an album had been released under that name.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band that formed in London in 1975. They were responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians. Although their initial career lasted just two-and-a-half years and produced only four singles and one studio album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, they are regarded as one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music.\nThe Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock. Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977. Under the management of impresario Malcolm McLaren, the band provoked controversies that took Britain by storm. Their concerts repeatedly faced difficulties with organizers and authorities, and public appearances often ended in mayhem. Their 1977 single \"God Save the Queen\", attacking Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, precipitated the \"last and greatest outbreak of pop-based moral pandemonium\".\nIn January 1978, at the end of a turbulent tour of the United States, Rotten left the band and announced its break-up. Over the next several months, the three other band members recorded songs for McLaren's film version of the Sex Pistols' story, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle. Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979. In 1996, Rotten, Jones, Cook and Matlock reunited for the Filthy Lucre Tour; since 2002, they have staged further reunion shows and tours. On 24 February 2006, the Sex Pistols-the four original members plus Vicious-were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but they refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum \"a piss stain\".",

Their biggest hit in the mainstream is an a capella single, “If I Ever Fall in Love,” which made #2 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.\n\nShai was formed at Howard University in Washington D.C. Three of the four members, Marc Gray, Carl Martin, and Darnell Van Rensalier, belonged to the same fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha, and along with good friend, Garfield A. Bright, decided to take a chance at turning their hobby of singing into a career. Moving to New York City, New York, the foursome tried to secure a record deal, but they couldn't find any takers. With their money running out and their future looking bleak, the members of Shai took a chance on a radio contest that radio station WPGC was sponsoring. They chose to perform a song that Carl Martin wrote, “If I Ever Fall in Love,” which they sang a cappella. The song won the contest and began finding airplay on WPGC. Other stations soon followed, and suddenly the record labels came calling. After signing with Gasoline Alley, Shai began putting together its debut album.\n\n“If I Ever Fall in Love” was the first single and peaked at #2 in the U.S. The next two releases from the double-platinum album, “Comforter” and “Baby I'm Yours” both reached #10. The group’s next CD was a remix album largely consisting of new versions of their previous hits, which resulted in a revised version of the song “Baby I'm Yours” simply titled “Yours” which peaked at #63. Future efforts fell shy of the Top 40 although the group did briefly reappear there in 1994 with the #34 “The Place Where You Belong” from the Beverly Hills Cop III soundtrack. The group’s last charting single was 1996’s #89 single “I Don't Wanna Be Alone”. Shai is still active releasing such albums as “Destiny” (1999), “Back From The Mystery System: The Love Cycle” (2004), “Love Cycle: Back From The Mystery System” (2007) and “Worldwide (as D-n-G of Shai)” (2009).",

Born and raised in Barranquilla, she began performing in school, demonstrating Latin, Arabic, and rock and roll influences and belly dancing abilities. Shakira released her first studio albums, Magia and Peligro, in the early 1990s, failing to attain commercial success; however, she rose to prominence in Latin America with her major-label debut, Pies Descalzos (1996), and her fourth album, Dónde Están los Ladrones? (1998).\nShakira entered the English-language market with her fifth album, Laundry Service. Its lead single, \"Whenever, Wherever\", became the best-selling single of 2002. Her success was solidified with her sixth and seventh albums Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 and Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 (2005), the latter of which spawned the best-selling song of the 21st century, \"Hips Don't Lie\". Shakira's eighth and ninth albums, She Wolf (2009) and Sale el Sol (2010), received critical praise but suffered from limited promotion due to her strained relationship with label Epic Records. Her official song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\", became the biggest-selling World Cup song of all time. With over 950 million views, it's one of the most-watched music videos on YouTube. Since 2013, Shakira has served as a coach on the American version of The Voice, having appeared in two of its seven seasons—fourth and sixth. Her tenth album, Shakira (2014), is preceded by its lead single, \"Can't Remember to Forget You\".\nShakira has won many awards, including five MTV Video Music Awards, two Grammy Awards, eight Latin Grammy Awards, seven Billboard Music Awards, 28 Billboard Latin Music Awards and has been Golden Globe-nominated. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and sold between 70 and 125 million records worldwide (depending to the source), making her one of the best selling Latin artist of all time. She carries out well-known philanthropic activities through charity work and benefit concerts, notably her Pies Descalzos Foundation, her performance at the \"Clinton Global Initiative\" created by former U.S. President Bill Clinton, and her invitation to the Oval Office by President Barack Obama in February 2010 to discuss early childhood development. In 2014, she was listed as the 58th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes. In July 2014, Shakira became the first person to reach 100 million followers on Facebook.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Shania Twain, OC (born Eilleen Regina Edwards; August 28, 1965) is a Canadian country pop singer-songwriter. Her 1995 album The Woman in Me brought her fame, and her 1997 album Come On Over became the best-selling album of all time by a female musician in any genre, and the best-selling country album of all time. It has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide. Her fourth album, Up!, was released in November 2002. To date it has sold 20 million copies worldwide.\nTwain has won five Grammy Awards and 27 BMI Songwriter awards. She has had three albums certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America and is the second best-selling artist in Canada, behind Céline Dion, with three of her studio albums certified double diamond by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. She is the first (and currently only) female artist in history to have 3 consecutive albums reach diamond status, certified by the RIAA. Sometimes referred to as \"The Queen of Country Pop\", Twain has sold more than 75 million albums worldwide and is ranked 10th best-selling artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era. She was also ranked 72nd on Billboard's \"Artists of the decade\" (2000-10). Most recently, Twain has her own TV series, Why Not? with Shania Twain, that premiered on the OWN on May 8, 2011. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on June 2, 2011.\nShania Twain was born Eilleen Regina Edwards in Windsor, Ontario, daughter of Sharon (née Morrison) and Clarence Edwards. Her parents divorced when she was two and her mother then moved to Timmins, Ontario with Eilleen and her sisters Jill and Carrie Ann. Sharon married Jerry Twain, an Ojibwa, and they had a son together, Mark. Jerry adopted the girls, legally changing their last name to Twain. When Mark was still in diapers, the Twains adopted Jerry's baby nephew, Darryl, after Darryl's mother died. Because of her connection to her stepfather, in the past, people had presumed Twain's ancestry was Ojibwa, but she stated in an interview that her biological father was part Cree. Through her maternal grandfather, she is a descendant of Zacharie Cloutier. Her maternal grandmother, Eileen Pearce, emigrated from Newbridge, Kildare, Ireland.\nEilleen Twain had a hard childhood in Timmins. Her parents earned little and there was often a shortage of food in the household. Eilleen did not confide her situation to school authorities, fearing they might break up the family. In the remote, rugged community, she learned to hunt and to chop wood. Sharon and Jerry's marriage was at times stormy, and from a young age, Eilleen witnessed violent fights between them. Sharon struggled with bouts of depression. In the summer of 1979, while Jerry was at work, at Eilleen's insistence, her mother drove the rest of the family 680 kilometres (420 mi) south to a Toronto homeless shelter for assistance. Sharon returned to Jerry with the children in 1981. In Timmins, Twain started singing at bars at the age of eight to try to make ends meet, often earning twenty dollars between midnight and one in the morning performing for remaining customers after the bar had finished serving. Although she expressed a dislike for singing in those bars, Twain believes that this was her own kind of performing arts school on the road. She has said of the ordeal, \"My deepest passion was music and it helped. There were moments when I thought 'I hate this'. I hated going into bars and being with drunks. But I loved the music and so I survived\". Twain wrote her first songs at the age of ten, Is Love a Rose and Just Like the Storybooks which were fairy tales in rhyme. She states that the art of creating, of actually writing songs, \"was very different from performing them and became progressively important\".",

They formed the group Tom & Jerry in 1957 and had their first success with the minor hit \"Hey, Schoolgirl\". As Simon & Garfunkel, the duo rose to fame in 1965, largely on the strength of the hit single \"The Sound of Silence\". Their music was featured in the landmark film The Graduate (1967), propelling them further into the public consciousness.\n\nThey are well known for their vocal harmonies and were among the most popular recording artists of the 1960s. Their biggest hits - including \"The Sound of Silence\" (1964), \"I Am a Rock\" (1965), \"Homeward Bound\" (1965), \"Scarborough Fair/Canticle\" (1966), \"A Hazy Shade of Winter\" (1966), \"Mrs. Robinson\" (1968), \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" (1969), \"The Boxer\" (1969), and \"Cecilia\" (1969) - peaked at number one in several charts. They have received several Grammys and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nTheir sometimes rocky relationship led to their last album, Bridge Over Troubled Water, being delayed several times due to artistic disagreements and as a result the duo broke up in 1970. It was their most successful album worldwide to date, peaking at number one in several countries, including the United States, and receiving 8Ã— platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America, making it their highest-selling studio album in the U.S. and second-highest album overall. Simon & Garfunkel have, at times, reunited to perform and sometimes tour together. They have done so in every decade since the 1970 breakup, most famously for 1981's \"The Concert in Central Park\", which attracted more than 500,000 people, making it the 7th-most attended concert in the history of music. In 2004, they were ranked #40 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Slayer was an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California. The band was formed in 1981 by guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, drummer Dave Lombardo, and bassist and vocalist Tom Araya. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the \"big four\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Slayer's final lineup comprised King, Araya, drummer Paul Bostaph (who replaced Lombardo in 1992 and again in 2013) and guitarist Gary Holt (who replaced Hanneman in 2011). Drummer Jon Dette was also a member of the band.\n\nIn the original lineup, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, torture, genocide, politics, theories, human subject research, organized crime, secret societies, mythology, occultism, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion or antireligion, Nazism, fascism, racism, xenophobia, misanthropy, war and prison, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and factions of the general public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, Reign in Blood (1986), has been described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums.\n\nSlayer released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. Slayer sold 5 million copies in the United States from 1991 to 2013, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and over 20 million worldwide. The band has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \"Eyes of the Insane\" and one in 2008 for the song \"Final Six\", both of which were from the album Christ Illusion (2006). After more than three decades of recording and performing, Slayer announced in January 2018 that it would embark on a farewell tour, which took place from May 2018 to November 2019, after which the band disbanded.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Slipknot is an American nu metal band from Des Moines, Iowa. Formed in 1995, the group was founded by percussionist Shawn Crahan and bassist Paul Gray. After several lineup changes in their early days, the band consisted of nine members for the greater part of their tenure: Sid Wilson, Paul Gray, Joey Jordison, Chris Fehn, Jim Root, Craig Jones, Shawn Crahan, Mick Thomson, and Corey Taylor. However, the death of Paul Gray on May 24, 2010, left the band with only eight remaining members. Former guitarist Donnie Steele was the band's touring bassist in 2011.\n\nThe band is known for its attention-grabbing image; the members wear matching uniforms, have unique masks respectively and have aliases which are simply numbers. The original idea of wearing masks while performing is often attributed to a clown mask that percussionist Crahan would bring to rehearsals when the band first started. The concept developed, and by late 1997, the band decided that every member of the band would wear unique masks and matching jumpsuits. Vocalist Taylor had this to say when questioned about the masks in 2002: \"it's our way of becoming more intimate with the music. It's a way for us to become unconscious of who we are and what we do outside of music. It's a way for us to kind of crawl inside it and be able to use it.\" The concept behind wearing matching jumpsuits has been described as a response to commercialism in the music business and led to the idea of assigning the band members numerical aliases. \"Originally, we were just going to wear the jumpsuits  we figured we might as well take that further and number ourselves.  We were basically saying, 'Hey, we're a product!'\" explained Taylor. Their image has been the subject of much criticism, generally thought of as a gimmick to try sell more albums. The band strongly objects to these claims, proclaiming that the masks are used to draw the attention away from themselves as individuals and put it on the music. Several band members have noted that wearing the masks also helps keep their personal lives private. During an interview in 2005, percussionist Fehn went as far as saying it was a \"blessing\" that they do not get recognized.\n\nSlipknot has been the subject of many controversies throughout their career, both for their image and their music. The lyrical content of some of Slipknot's songs has been linked to several violent and criminal incidents. One such case from 2003 involved a pair of young killers who blamed the lyrics from the song \"Disasterpiece\" for their vicious crime. Another from 2006 involved the lyrics from the song \"Surfacing\" being found at the site of a grave robbing. Slipknot deny any responsibility in cases like this and to date have not been proven to be liable in any cases of this nature. In 2008, vocalist Taylor commented on a stabbing in South Africa that Slipknot were linked to, saying: \"obviously, I'm disturbed by the fact that people were hurt and someone died, as far as my responsibility for that goes, it stops there, because I know our message is actually very positive.\" Furthering his point by saying: \"there are always going to be mental disorders and people who cause violence for no other reason than the fact that they're fucked up and lost.\"",

Active from 1966 to 1983, the band was pivotal in the development of soul, funk, and psychedelic music. Headed by singer, songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist Sly Stone, and containing several of his family members and friends, the band was the first major American rock band to have an \"integrated, multi-gender\" lineup.\nBrothers Sly Stone and singer/guitarist Freddie Stone combined their bands (Sly & the Stoners and Freddie & the Stone Souls) in 1967. Sly and Freddie Stone, trumpeter Cynthia Robinson, drummer Gregg Errico, saxophonist Jerry Martini, and bassist Larry Graham completed the original lineup; Sly and Freddie's sister, singer/keyboardist Rose Stone, joined within a year. This collective recorded five Billboard Hot 100 hits which reached the top 10, and four ground-breaking albums, which greatly influenced the sound of American pop music, soul, R&B, funk, and hip hop music. In the preface of his 1998 book For the Record: Sly and the Family Stone: An Oral History, Joel Selvin sums up the importance of Sly and the Family Stone's influence on African American music by stating \"there are two types of black music: black music before Sly Stone, and black music after Sly Stone\". The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.\nDuring the early 1970s, the band switched to a grittier funk sound, which was as influential on the music industry as their earlier work. The band began to fall apart during this period because of drug abuse and ego clashes; consequently, the fortunes and reliability of the band deteriorated, leading to its dissolution in 1975. Sly Stone continued to record albums and tour with a new rotating lineup under the \"Sly and the Family Stone\" name from 1975 to 1983. In 1987, Sly Stone was arrested and sentenced for cocaine use, after which he went into effective retirement.",

The band is remembered as one of the most acclaimed and influential mod groups of the 1960s. With memorable hit songs such as \"Itchycoo Park\", \"Lazy Sunday\", \"All or Nothing\", \"Tin Soldier\", and their concept album Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake, they later evolved into one of the UK's most successful psychedelic acts before disbanding in 1969. After the Small Faces disbanded, three of the members were joined by Ronnie Wood as guitarist, and Rod Stewart as their lead vocalist, both from The Jeff Beck Group, and the new line-up was renamed Faces. A revived version of the original Small Faces existed from 1975 to 1978. Small Faces are also acknowledged as being one of the biggest original influences on the Britpop movement of the 1990s.Despite the fact the band were together just four years in their original incarnation, the Small Faces' music output from the mid to late sixties remains among the most acclaimed British mod and psychedelic music of that era.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Smashing Pumpkins are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois, formed in 1988. Formed by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, lead guitar) and James Iha (rhythm guitar), the band has included Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), D'arcy Wretzky (bass guitar), Melissa Auf der Maur (bass guitar), and currently includes Mike Byrne (drums), Nicole Fiorentino (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Jeff Schroeder (rhythm guitar) among its membership.\n\nDisavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, the Pumpkins have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, grunge, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegaze style production, and, in later recordings, electronica. Frontman Billy Corgan is the group's primary songwriter-his grand musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\".\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 18.75 million albums sold in the United States, The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up.\n\nIn 2006, Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. The band toured with a rotating lineup of between five and nine musicians through much of 2007 and 2008 with new member Jeff Schroeder before Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. New drummer Mike Byrne and bassist Nicole Fiorentino solidified a new lineup with Corgan and Schroeder, toured through much of 2010 and 2011, and are currently recording the album Teargarden by Kaleidyscope and the album-within-an-album Oceania.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Calvin Cordozar Broadus, Jr. (born October 20, 1971), better known by his stage name Snoop Dogg (formerly known as Snoop Doggy Dogg), is an American rapper, record producer, and actor. Snoop is best known as a rapper in the West Coast hip hop scene, and for being one of Dr. Dre's most notable protégés. Snoop Dogg was a Crip gang member while in high school. Shortly after graduation, he was arrested for cocaine possession and spent six months in Wayside County Jail. His music career began in 1992 after his release when he was discovered by Dr. Dre. He collaborated on several tracks on Dre's solo debut, The Chronic and on the titular theme song to the film Deep Cover.\n\nSnoop's debut album Doggystyle, was released in 1993 under Death Row Records making a debut at No.1 on both the Billboard 200 and R&B charts. Selling almost a million copies in the first week of its release, Doggystyle quickly became certified 4Ã— platinum in 1994 and spawned several hit singles, including \"What's My Name\" and \"Gin & Juice\". In 1994, Snoop released a soundtrack on Death Row Records for the short film Murder Was The Case, starring himself. In early 1996, Snoop Dogg was cleared of charges over his bodyguard's 1993 murder of Philip Woldemariam. His second album, late 1996's Tha Doggfather, also debuted at No.1 on both charts with \"Snoop's Upside Ya Head\" as the lead single. The album sold only half as well, being certified double platinum in 1997.\n\nTha Doggfather was his last release for Death Row before he signed with No Limit Records, where he recorded his next three albums. Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told in 1998, No Limit Top Dogg in 1999 (making it his last album of the 90s), and Tha Last Meal in 2000, which was his last No Limit Records album. Snoop then signed with Priority/Capitol/EMI Records in 2002, where he released his album Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss. Then he signed with Geffen Records in 2004 for his next three albums R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, and Ego Trippin'. Malice 'n Wonderland (2009) and Doggumentary (2011), his most recent release, were on Priority.\n\nIn addition to music, Snoop Dogg has starred in motion pictures and hosted several television shows: Doggy Fizzle Televizzle, Snoop Dogg's Father Hood and Dogg After Dark. He also coaches a youth football league and high school football team. He has run into many legal troubles, some of which caused him to be legally banned from the UK and Australia, although the UK ban was later reversed after a long legal battle. He is the cousin of Nate Dogg, Daz Dillinger, RBX and Lil' Â½ Dead and the cousin of R&B singers Brandy and Ray J. Starting September 2009, Snoop was hired by EMI as the chairman of a reactivated Priority Records.",

Their most recent lineup consisted of Thurston Moore (guitar and vocals), Kim Gordon (bass guitar, vocals, and guitar), Lee Ranaldo (guitar and vocals), Steve Shelley (drums), and Mark Ibold (guitar and bass).\nIn their early career, Sonic Youth was associated with the no wave art and music scene in New York City. Part of the first wave of American noise rock groups, the band carried out their interpretation of the hardcore punk ethos throughout the evolving American underground that focused more on the DIY ethic of the genre rather than its specific sound. As a result, some consider Sonic Youth as pivotal in the rise of the alternative rock and indie rock movements. The band experienced success and critical acclaim throughout their existence, continuing into the new millennium, including signing to major label DGC in 1990, and headlining the 1995 Lollapalooza festival.\nSonic Youth expressed a wide variety of influences, ranging from the influential protopunk musician Patti Smith to composer John Cage. The band was praised for having \"redefined what rock guitar could do\", using a wide variety of unorthodox guitar tunings, and preparing guitars with objects like drum sticks and screwdrivers to alter the instruments' timbre. In 2011, Ranaldo announced that the band was \"ending for a while,\" following Moore and Gordon's separation.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "A proudly idiosyncratic singer and songwriter who embraces an eclectic range of musical influences and isn't afraid to be nakedly confessional in her music, Sophie B. Hawkins enjoyed unexpected commercial success with her debut album, but since then has opted to follow her muse rather than a major label's marketing department. Sophie Ballantine Hawkins was born in New York City on November 1, 1967. Hawkins grew up in a family that valued art and creativity but was troubled by alcoholism, and as a child she aspired to be an English teacher. At the age of 14, Hawkins became fascinated with African music and began studying percussion, becoming a student of celebrated African musician Babatunde Olatunji. As Hawkins became more accomplished, she branched out into jazz and became proficient on marimba and vibraphone as well as drums. After finishing high school, Hawkins enrolled in the Manhattan School of Music, and in addition to world music and jazz, she began dipping her toes into rock and pop music, playing trap drums with a band called the Pink Men and a handful of other groups.\n\nHawkins took up singing and writing songs, and recorded a demo tape that made its way to Roxy Music frontman Bryan Ferry, who hired her to play percussion and sing backup in his road band for two months. Hawkins took odd jobs and sang on commercial jingles to support herself until her demo came to the attention of an A&R man at Columbia Records, who signed Hawkins to a record deal. Working with producers Rick Chertoff and Ralph Schuckett, Hawkins' first album, 1992's Tongues and Tails, suggested the breadth of her influences, with jazz, R&B, pop, rock, and African music informing the 11 tunes. One of the songs, \"Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover,\" became a major hit single, rising to number five on the Billboard pop charts, and Tongues and Tails became a commercial and critical success. That same year, Hawkins was invited to sing Bob Dylan's \"I Want You\" (which she covered on her album) at an all-star concert paying tribute to Dylan's 30th anniversary as a recording artist.\n\nHawkins worked with producer Steve Lipson for her next album, 1994's Whaler; the album was a commercial disappointment on first release, but close to a year after it arrived in stores, the single \"As I Lay Me Down\" unexpectedly took off and rose to the Top Ten. Hawkins took the creative lead on her third album, Timbre, producing the sessions and playing a wider range of instruments than before; however, Columbia Records was unhappy with the results and wanted Hawkins to re-record part of the album. Hawkins refused, and while the album was eventually released in 1999 in her approved version, Columbia did little to promote the release, and she and the label parted ways. Hawkins formed her own independent label, Trumpet Swan Productions, and reissued Timbre in expanded form in 2001. (While Hawkins was in her standoff with Columbia, she participated in a documentary about her life and music called The Cream Will Rise, directed by her life partner, Gigi Gaston.) Hawkins' first new album for Trumpet Swan, Wilderness, was released in 2004, and a live album, Bad Kitty Board Mix, appeared in 2006. In 2008, Hawkins became a mother for the first time, and it wasn't until 2012 that she returned to music with the album The Crossing. In addition to her work in music, Hawkins is an outspoken activist for animal rights and environmental issues, and against child abuse.",

She first came to prominence in the late 1990s, as the lead singer of the indie rock band Theaudience. After the group disbanded, Ellis-Bextor went solo, achieving widespread success in the early 2000s. Her music is a mixture of mainstream pop, disco, nu-disco, and 1980s electronic influences.\nHer solo debut album, Read My Lips, was released in September 2001. The album reached number two on the UK albums chart and was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The record experienced international success, selling more than 2 million copies worldwide. It produced four singles, three of which reached the top three in the UK. In 2003, Read My Lips won the Edison Award for \"Best Dance Album\". Ellis-Bextor's second album, Shoot from the Hip, was released in October 2003. The album reached number nineteen in the UK and produced two top ten singles. Trip the Light Fantastic, her third album, was released in May 2007 and reached number seven in the UK. The album produced three singles, one of which reached the top ten in the UK.\nIn 2009, Ellis-Bextor released the Freemasons collaboration \"Heartbreak (Make Me a Dancer)\" and her first extended play, Sophie Ellis-Bextor: iTunes Live in London. Her fourth studio album, Make a Scene, was released in April 2011.\nEllis-Bextor appeared with her mother Janet Ellis along in a children's DVD compilation songs video entitled 'a day full of songs' which was released by retailer Marks & Spencer. She began her musical career in 1997, with an indie band called Theaudience. Ellis-Bextor sang the lead vocal in the band. While she was a band member, readers of Melody Maker elected her to the number-one position among the 'most sexy people in rock'. She recorded a duet with Manic Street Preachers-\"Black Holes for the Young\"-as a B-side for their 1998 single \"The Everlasting\". Several songs released by Theaudience are \"I Got the Wherewithal\", \"If You Can't Do It When You're Young; When Can You Do It?\", \"I Know Enough (I Don't Get Enough)\", and \"A Pessimist Is Never Disappointed\" (perhaps their best-known single). The band split in December 1998. In 1999, Ellis-Bextor made an appearance on the Departure Lounge album Out of Here.",

Soundgarden was the first grunge band to sign to a major label (A&M Records, in 1988), though the band did not achieve commercial success until they popularized \"grunge\" in the early 1990s with Seattle contemporaries Nirvana, Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam.\nSoundgarden achieved its biggest success with the 1994 album Superunknown, which debuted at number one on the Billboard charts and yielded the Grammy Award-winning singles \"Black Hole Sun\" and \"Spoonman\". In 1997, the band broke up due to internal strife over its creative direction. After several years working on projects and other bands, Soundgarden reunited in 2010 and is currently working on a new album, which is slated for release in October 2012.\nAs of 2010, Soundgarden had sold over 10 million records in the United States, and an estimated 21 million worldwide.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Status Quo are one of Britain's longest-lived bands, staying together for over 40 years. During much of that time, the band was only successful in the U.K., where it racked up a string of Top Ten singles across the decades. In America, the Quo were ignored after they abandoned psychedelia for heavy boogie rock in the early '70s. Before that, the band managed to reach number 12 in the U.S. with the psychedelic classic \"Pictures of Matchstick Men\" (a Top Ten hit in the U.K.). Following that single, the band suffered a lean period for the next few years, before the bandmembers decided to refashion themselves as a hard rock boogie band in 1970 with their Ma Kelly's Greasy Spoon album. The Quo have basically recycled the same simple boogie on each successive album and single, yet their popularity has never waned in Britain. If anything, their very predictability has ensured the group a large following.\n\nThe origins of Status Quo lie in a London-based beat group called the Spectres. Francis Rossi (vocals, guitar) and Alan Lancaster (bass) were the core members of the Spectres from their inception; within a few years, the band had added drummer John Coughlan and organist Roy Lynes. The Spectres released three unsuccessful singles before changing their style to psychedelia and adopting the name Traffic Jam and releasing the unsuccessful single \"Almost But Not Quite There.\" After it flopped, the group added Rick Parfitt (guitar, vocals), formerly of the cabaret band the Highlights. When Parfitt joined the band in August 1967, the group again changed its name, this time to Status Quo.\n\nAt first, Status Quo backed British solo artists, including Tommy Quickly, while working on their own material. \"Pictures of Matchstick Men,\" the group's debut single, was released at the beginning of 1968 and quickly shot to number seven on the U.K. charts; within a few months, it was a number 12 in the U.S. as well. The immediate follow-up single, \"Black Veils of Melancholy,\" was a flop, but \"Ice in the Sun,\" written by former British pop star Marty Wilde, became Status Quo's second Top Ten hit in the fall of 1968. Over in America, the single barely registered, squeaking to number 70; it was the last time the group would ever chart in the U.S.\n\nFor the next year, Status Quo tried to replicate the success of their first two singles with similar psychedelic material, but they had little luck. Finally, they revamped their sound - and jettisoned organist Lynes - in the summer of 1970, debuting their new heavy, bluesy boogie rock with the single \"Down the Dustpipe.\" The single reached number 12, yet the full-fledged hard rock album Ma Kelly's Greasy Spoon didn't gain much attention. Status Quo began playing concerts regularly across England, slowly building up a strong following in England. Following well-received sets at 1972's Reading and Great Western festivals, the band became a hot property. The Quo signed with Vertigo Records and their first single for the label, \"Paper Plane,\" cracked the Top Ten in early 1973, while their first album for Vertigo, Piledriver, reached number five. Later that year, Hello entered the charts at number one, while its accompanying single, \"Caroline,\" reached number five. Also in 1973, keyboardist Andy Bown, formerly of the Herd and Judas Jump, became the band's unofficial keyboardist.\n\nThroughout the '70s, each album Status Quo released went into the Top Five, while their singles - including the number one \"Down Down\" (1974), \"Roll Over Lay Down\" (1975), \"Rain\" (1976), \"Wild Side of Life\" (1976), and a cover of John Fogerty's \"Rockin' All Over the World\" (1977) - consistently hit the Top Ten and frequently went gold. Since they were experiencing a great deal of success, they didn't change their sound at all, they just kept churning out the same heavy boogie. America basically ignored Status Quo, yet their eponymous album managed to chart at 148 in 1976. Nevertheless, they were an English phenomenon, and England continued to support them even when pop music was undergoing drastic changes in the late '70s.\n\nFollowing the release of 1980's Just Supposin', drummer John Coughlan left the band in 1981 to form his own group, Diesel. Former Original Mirrors drummer Pete Kircher replaced him; his first appearance with the group was 1982's Never Too Late. During the early '80s, tensions escalated between bassist Lancaster and guitarists Rossi and Parfitt, who were the group's main songwriters. Lancaster left the Quo after performing with them for a final time at Live Aid. He subsequently took Rossi and Parfitt to court to prevent them from using the name \"Status Quo.\" Lancaster lost his battle, and the name became the property of the guitarists.\n\nOnce the lawsuit was settled, Rossi and Parfitt assembled a new band, hiring bassist John Edwards, drummer Jeff Rich, and keyboardist Andy Bown, who officially became a member of the group. The new lineup continued Status Quo's remarkable success, as they racked up a number of new Top Ten singles and hit albums, as well as consistently selling out concerts across England and Europe. In 1994, the group had its second number one hit of its career, with the football anthem \"Come on You Reds\"; the single was recorded with the football champions, Manchester United. By the mid-'90s, Status Quo had scored 50 British hit singles, which was a greater number than any other band in rock & roll history. \n\nIn April 1997 Parfitt underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery but fully recovered and continued performing and recording with the Quo in the years to follow. Drummer Rich departed the band in 2000, replaced by Matt Letley, who has continued on with the band in the 21st century. The single \"Jam Side Down\" was a Top 20 hit in the U.K. during 2002, a year that also saw the release of the critically acclaimed Heavy Traffic album. The all-covers outing Don’t Stop arrived in 2004, followed by The Party Ain’t Over Yet in 2005 and In Search of the Fourth Chord in 2007.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Steely Dan is an American rock band consisting of core members Donald Fagen and Walter Becker. The band's popularity peaked in the late 1970s, with the release of seven albums blending elements of jazz, rock, funk, R&B, and pop. Rolling Stone has called them \"the perfect musical antiheroes for the Seventies.\"\nThe band's music is characterized by complex jazz-influenced structures and harmonies played by Becker and Fagen along with a revolving cast of rock and pop studio musicians. Steely Dan's \"cerebral, wry and eccentric\" lyrics, often filled with sharp sarcasm, touch upon such themes as drugs, love affairs, and crime. The pair is well known for their near-obsessive perfectionism in the recording studio, the most extreme example being that Becker and Fagen used at least 42 different studio musicians, 11 engineers, and took over a year to record the tracks that resulted in 1980's Gaucho - an album that contains only seven songs.\nSteely Dan toured from 1972 to 1974, but in 1975 became a purely studio-based act. The late 1970s saw the group release a series of moderately successful singles and albums. They disbanded in 1981, and throughout most of the next decade Fagen and Becker remained largely inactive in the music world. During this time \"a cult following\" remained devoted to the group. In 1993, the group resumed playing live concerts; later Steely Dan released two albums of new material, the first of which earned a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. They have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2001.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Steppenwolf is a Canadian-American rock group that was prominent in the late 1960s. The group was formed in 1963 in Los Angeles by vocalist John Kay, guitarist Michael Monarch, bassist Rushton Moreve, keyboardist Goldy McJohn and drummer Jerry Edmonton after the dissolution of Toronto group The Sparrows, formed by John Kay in the early 60s, of which only Moreve was not a member.\nThe band has sold more than 25 million records worldwide, releasing eight gold albums and twelve Billboard Hot 100 singles of which six were Top 40 hits, including three Top 10 successes: \"Born to Be Wild\", \"Magic Carpet Ride\", and \"Rock Me\". Steppenwolf enjoyed worldwide success from 1968 to 1974, but clashing personalities led to the end of the core lineup. Today, frontman John Kay is the only original member left, having served as lead singer for more than 40 years since 1963. The name-change from The Sparrows to Steppenwolf was suggested to John Kay by Gabriel Mekler, being inspired by Hermann Hesse's novel of the same name. Steppenwolf's first two singles were \"A Girl I Knew\" and \"Sookie Sookie\". The band finally rocketed to worldwide fame after their third single \"Born to Be Wild\" was released in 1968, as well as their version of Hoyt Axton's \"The Pusher\" and were prominently used in the 1969 cult film Easy Rider (both titles originally had been released on the band's debut album). In the movie, \"The Pusher\" accompanies a drug deal, and Peter Fonda stuffing dollar bills into his Stars & Stripes-clad fuel tank, after which \"Born to Be Wild\" is heard in the opening credits, with Fonda and Dennis Hopper riding their Harley choppers through the American West. The song, which has been closely associated with motorcycles ever since, introduced to rock lyrics the signature term \"heavy metal\" (though not about a kind of music, but about a motorcycle: \"I like smoke and lightning, heavy metal thunder, racin' with the wind...\"). Written by Dennis Edmonton, who had begun using the pen name Mars Bonfire, the song had already reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1968. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.\nThe following albums had several more hit singles, including \"Magic Carpet Ride\" (which reached No. 3) from Steppenwolf The Second and \"Rock Me Baby\" (with its bridge lasting 1:06, which reached No. 10) from At Your Birthday Party. It also sold in excess of one million units. Monster, which questioned US policy of the Nixon era, and Steppenwolf 7 were the band's most political albums, which included the song \"Snowblind Friend\", another Axton-penned song, about the era and attitudes of drugs and its problems. Other hits included Hey Lawdy Mama and Willie Dixon's Hootchie Kootchie Man.\nThere were several changes in the group's personnel after the first few years. Moreve was fired from the group in 1968 for missing gigs after he became afraid to return to Los Angeles, convinced that it was going to be leveled by an earthquake and fall into the sea. Rob Black filled in for Moreve until former fellow-Sparrow Nick St. Nicholas came aboard. Monarch quit after disagreements with Kay the next year year and was replaced by Larry Byrom, who'd been in TIME with St. Nicholas. St. Nicholas' tenure with the group proved to be brief and he was let go in 1970 after incurring Kay's wrath by showing up onstage in a bunny suit, and playing his bass loudly and out of tune. The above tales were related by Kay in his 1994 autobiography Magic Carpet Ride (co-written with Canadian author John Einarson). George Biondo was then recruited and guitarist Kent Henry replaced Byrom in 1971.\nThe band broke up in 1972 following the release of another political concept album, For Ladies Only, and Kay went on to an inconsistent solo career, scoring a minor solo hit in 1972 with \"I'm Movin' On\" from his album Forgotten Songs and Unsung Heroes.\nKay toured Europe as The John Kay Band in 1972 with Steppenwolf also on the bill, Kay fronting both groups.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Steve Miller's career has encompassed two distinct stages: one of the top San Francisco blues-rockers during the late '60s and early '70s, and one of the top-selling pop/rock acts of the mid- to late '70s and early '80s with hits like \"The Joker,\" \"Fly Like an Eagle,\" \"Rock'n Me,\" and \"Abracadabra.\" Miller was turned on to music by his father, who worked as a pathologist but knew stars like Charles Mingus and Les Paul, whom he brought home as guests; Paul taught the young Miller some guitar chords and let him sit in on a session. Miller formed a blues band, the Marksmen Combo, at age 12 with friend Boz Scaggs; the two teamed up again at the University of Wisconsin in a group called the Ardells, later the Fabulous Night Trains. Miller moved to Chicago in 1964 to get involved in the local blues scene, teaming with Barry Goldberg for two years.\nHe then moved to San Francisco and formed the first incarnation of the Steve Miller Blues Band, featuring guitarist James \"Curly\" Cooke, bassist Lonnie Turner, and drummer Tim Davis. The band built a local following through a series of free concerts and backed Chuck Berry in 1967 at a Fillmore date later released as a live album. Scaggs moved to San Francisco later that year and replaced Cooke in time to play the Monterey Pop Festival; it was the first of many personnel changes. Capitol signed the group as the Steve Miller Band following the festival. \n\nThe band flew to London to record Children of the Future, which was praised by critics and received some airplay on FM radio. It established Miller's early style as a blues-rocker influenced but not overpowered by psychedelia. The follow-up, Sailor, has been hailed as perhaps Miller's best early effort; it reached number 24 on the Billboard album charts and consolidated Miller's fan base. A series of high-quality albums with similar chart placements followed; while Miller remained a popular artist, pop radio failed to pick up on any of his material at this time, even though tracks like \"Space Cowboy\" and \"Brave New World\" had become FM rock staples. Released in 1971, Rock Love broke Miller's streak with a weak band lineup and poor material, and Miller followed it with the spotty Recall the Beginning: A Journey from Eden. Things began to look even worse for Miller when he broke his neck in a car accident and subsequently developed hepatitis, which put him out of commission for most of 1972 and early 1973. \n\nMiller spent his recuperation time reinventing himself as a blues-influenced pop/rocker, writing compact, melodic, catchy songs. This approach was introduced on his 1973 LP, The Joker, and was an instant success, with the album going platinum and the title track hitting number one on the pop charts. Now an established star, Miller elected to take three years off. He purchased a farm and built his own recording studio, at which he crafted the wildly successful albums Fly Like an Eagle and Book of Dreams at approximately the same time. Fly Like an Eagle was released in 1976 and eclipsed its predecessor in terms of quality and sales (over four million copies) in spite of the long downtime in between. It also gave Miller his second number one hit with \"Rock'n Me,\" plus several other singles. Book of Dreams was almost as successful, selling over three million copies and producing several hits as well. All of the hits from Miller's first three pop-oriented albums were collected on Greatest Hits 1974-1978, which to date has sold over six million copies and remains a popular catalog item. \n\nMiller again took some time off, not returning again until late 1981 with the disappointing Circle of Love. Just six months later, Miller rebounded with Abracadabra; the title track gave him his third number one single. The remaining albums released in the '80s -- Italian X Rays,1984; Living in the 20th Century, 1986; and Born 2B Blue, 1988 -- weren't consistent enough to be critically or commercially successful. The early '90s saw Miller return to form with Wide River (the title track becoming a Top 40 chart entry) and the release of a retrospective box set compiled by the artist himself. Miller continued to headline shows into the 2000s, sharing the bill with classic rock acts such as 2008 tourmate Joe Cocker. He also announced the impending release of a new studio album of R&B covers. In 2010, the band released Bingo!, the first release on Miller's own Space Cowboy Records.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Stephanie Lynn “Stevie” Nicks (born May 26, 1948) is an American singer and songwriter from Phoenix, Arizona, best known for her work with Fleetwood Mac and a long successful solo career. Her ethereal visual style and symbolic lyrics have brought her critical acclaim and have proved influential to many female artists. She was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, as a member of Fleetwood Mac. Nicks has been nominated for seven Grammy Awards. Her classic song, “Silver Springs” was originally to be part of the best-selling Rumours album by Fleetwood Mac. Mick Fleetwood said it was too long and it was replaced by “Second Hand News.” Nicks was crushed. The song was the b-side of the “Go Your Own Way” 45 vinyl. It never appeared on any album until 1992 on the 4-CD Box Set Fleetwood Mac “The Chain.” In 1997 when the group reunited to do “The Dance” Reunion Tour, in 1997, she performed Silver Springs and earned a Grammy nomination the following year for “Best Pop Female Performance.” The song was a gift to her mother, Barbara Nicks - who calls it her “rainy day” song, and finally appeared on her 2007 CD. Warner Bros. wouldn’t let her put it on “TimeSpace” her 1991, first “Best Of” collection, which further deepened the rift between her solo career and her career with Fleetwood Mac. Ever the diplomat, she’s one of the few women in rock to have a successful solo career with a band (she’s been performing and recording with Fleetwood Mac for 35 years - and a successful solo career with highs and lows, since 1981. Her career took off again at age 50, with the release of of her 3-CD Box Set “The Enchanted Works of Stevie Nicks” in 1998 - and she’s been going strong ever since. Her vocal coach, Steve Real, travels with her, and she does 45 minutes of vocal exercises before her shows. Years of touring, nearly destroyed her vocal cords. At one point, she had to get cortisone shots injected directly to her cords to keep up with the heavy demands of Fleetwood Mac’s touring schedule. She beat the odds - overcoming major addictions (cocaine in 1986; and an addiction to tranquilizers in 1994). At the close of “Gold Dust Woman,” on her solo tours she adds a verse to the early hit: “Take a look at me now…you should see me now…” And there’s a well-deserved triumph in her eyes. A survivor, still sells out stadiums at age 61, loves her audiences; she is a legend in her own time.”\nIn the past Stevie Nicks has mainly written alone, but for In Your Dreams, which was released May 3, 2011, she collaborated with Dave Stewart on seven of the tracks. Songfacts reports that Nicks re-connected with Stewart at a pilot for an interview show with Jimmy Iovine and decided there and then she would ask him to produce her next record. Nicks then gave Stewart a binder of 40 poems before they started working together. \n“With Dave and me, he had thousands of chords and this amazing musical knowledge, and I had thousands of pages of poetry - and I know six chords. It was like an amazing little meeting of the minds, and I immediately went, ‘Well this is just great!’” explained Nicks to Billboard.com. ",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Stephen \"Stevie\" Ray Vaughan (October 3, 1954 – August 27, 1990) was an American guitarist, singer-songwriter, and record producer. Often referred to by his initials SRV, Vaughan is best known as a founding member and leader of Double Trouble. Together with drummer Chris Layton and bassist Tommy Shannon, they ignited the blues revival of the 1980s. With a career spanning seven years, Vaughan and Double Trouble consistently sold out concerts while their albums frequently went gold.\nHe was born and raised in Dallas, Texas, and for a short period of time lived in Graham, Texas.  As the younger brother of Jimmie Vaughan, Vaughan started playing the guitar at age seven and formed several bands that occasionally performed in local nightclubs. At age 17, he dropped out of high school and moved to Austin to further pursue his musical career, joining groups such as Krackerjack, the Nightcrawlers, and the Cobras. In 1977, he formed Triple Threat Revue, a band that eventually evolved into Double Trouble and regularly performed around Austin. In 1982, Vaughan and Double Trouble performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, catching the attention of musicians David Bowie and Jackson Browne. Bowie asked Vaughan to play on his upcoming studio album Let's Dance, while Browne offered the band free use of his personal studio in Los Angeles to record an album.\nIn March 1983, Vaughan and Double Trouble were signed to Epic Records by veteran record producer John Hammond Sr. and released their debut album, Texas Flood in June of that year. After successful touring, the group released the albums, Couldn't Stand the Weather (1984) and Soul to Soul (1985), the latter of which featured new keyboardist Reese Wynans. Although his career had progressed successfully, Vaughan checked into a rehabilitation hospital in Atlanta, Georgia to give up a cocaine and alcohol habit and returned to touring with the band. In June 1989, In Step was released and earned them a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Performance. On August 27, 1990, Vaughan was killed in a helicopter crash following a performance in East Troy, Wisconsin.\nVaughan's uniquely eclectic yet intense style was derived from a variety of musical genres. He was influenced by blues musicians including Albert King, Freddie King, Otis Rush, and Muddy Waters, and rock guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Lonnie Mack, along with jazz instrumentalists like Kenny Burrell. His guitar playing reflected the classic blues and pentatonic scales but his creativity and raw talent took it to a whole new level previously unheard by any other guitarist. He has received wide critical recognition for his guitar playing, ranking at #6 on Rolling Stone's list of \"100 Greatest Guitarists\" in 2011. He was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2000 and a memorial statue was erected in Austin's Auditorium Shores park.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "After disbanding the Police at the peak of their popularity in 1984, Sting quickly established himself as a viable solo artist, one obsessed with expanding the boundaries of pop music. Sting incorporated heavy elements of jazz, classical, and worldbeat into his music, writing lyrics that were literate and self-consciously meaningful, and he was never afraid to emphasize this fact in the press. For such unabashed ambition, he was equally loved and reviled, with supporters believing that he was at the forefront of literate, intelligent rock and his critics finding his entire body of work pompous. Either way, Sting remained one of pop's biggest superstars for the first ten years of his solo career, before his record sales began to slip.\nBefore the Police were officially disbanded, Sting began work on his first solo album late in 1984, rounding up a group of jazz musicians as a supporting band. Moving from bass to guitar, he recorded his solo debut, 1985's The Dream of the Blue Turtles, with Branford Marsalis, Kenny Kirkland, and Omar Hakim. The move wasn't entirely unexpected, since Sting had played with jazz and progressive rock bands in his youth, but the result was considerably more mature and diverse than any Police record. The album became a hit, with \"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free,\" \"Love Is the Seventh Wave,\" and \"Fortress Around Your Heart\" reaching the American Top Ten. Sting brought the band out on an extensive tour and filmed the proceedings for a 1986 documentary called Bring on the Night, which appeared alongside a live double album of the same name. That year, Sting participated in a half-hearted Police reunion that resulted in only one new song, a re-recorded version of \"Don't Stand So Close to Me.\"\nFollowing the aborted Police reunion, Sting began working on the ambitious Nothing Like the Sun, which was dedicated to his recently deceased mother. Proceeding from a jazz foundation, and again collaborating with Marsalis, Sting worked with a number of different musicians on the album, including Gil Evans and former Police guitarist Andy Summers. The album received generally positive reviews upon its release in late 1987, and it generated hit singles with \"We'll Be Together\" and \"They Dance Alone.\" Following its release, Sting began actively campaigning for Amnesty International and environmentalism, establishing the Rainforest Foundation, which was designed to raise awareness about preserving the Brazilian rainforest. An abridged Spanish version of Nothing Like the Sun, Nada Como el Sol, was released in 1988.\nSting took several years to deliver the follow-up to Nothing Like the Sun, during which time he appeared in a failed Broadway revival of The Threepenny Opera in 1989. His father also died, which inspired 1991's The Soul Cages, a dense, dark, and complex album. Although the album peaked at number two and spawned the Top Ten hit \"All This Time,\" the record was less successful than its predecessor. Two years later, he delivered Ten Summoner's Tales, a light, pop-oriented record that became a hit on the strength of two Top 20 singles, \"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\" and \"Fields of Gold.\" At the end of 1993, \"All for Love,\" a song he recorded with Rod Stewart and Bryan Adams for The Three Musketeers, became a number one hit. The single confirmed that Sting's audience had shifted from new wave/college rock fans to adult contemporary, and the 1994 compilation Fields of Gold: The Best of Sting played to that new fan base.\nThree years after Ten Summoner's Tales, Sting released Mercury Falling in the spring of 1996. Although the album debuted highly, it quickly fell down the charts, stalling at platinum sales and failing to generate a hit single. Although the album failed, Sting remained a popular concert attraction, a feat that confirmed his immense popularity regardless of his chart status. Released in 1999, Brand New Day turned his commercial fortunes around in a big way, though, eventually going triple-platinum and earning two Grammy Awards. Issued in 2003, Sacred Love also did well, and Sting spent several years with the reunited Police before returning to his solo game for 2009's If on a Winter's Night.... One year later, he hit the road alongside the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, who added their own symphonic arrangements to his material. Symphonicities, a companion CD, and Live in Berlin, released in conjunction with the world tour, arrived that same year.",

Original members Joel Ekman (drums, percussion) and Shawn Economaki (bass guitar) left the group in 2006 and 2012 respectively.\nTo date, Stone Sour have released three studio albums Stone Sour (2002); Come What(ever) May (2006) and Audio Secrecy (2010). Their next studio effort will be titled House of Gold and Bones and will be released in two parts in Autumn 2012 and early 2013. They also released a digital live album, Live in Moscow, in 2007.\n\nStone Sour earned the group two Grammy Award nominations, both for Best Metal Performance, for the singles \"Get Inside\", in 2003, and \"Inhale\", in 2004. The album went on to become RIAA certified Gold. In 2006, following the release of Come What(ever) May, the group received another Grammy Award nomination for Best Metal Performance for the single \"30/30-150\".\n\nStone Sour was founded by Corey Taylor, who eventually became the vocalist of Slipknot, and former drummer Joel Ekman. Taylor's longtime friend Shawn Economaki joined shortly after, and filled in as the bass player. The band had played clubs and bars with different guitarists, who often filled the position for just one show. During these formative years, Stone Sour recorded 2 demo tapes, in 1992 and 1994. Shortly after, in 1995, Jim Root, who is now also part of Slipknot with Taylor, joined the band. The group was complete, and in 1996, it recorded another demo tape, songs from which would later be used in 2002 on their self-titled debut album, Stone Sour. The band was named after an alcoholic drink that consists of one part whiskey, one part orange juice, with a splash of sour mix.\n\nIn 1997, the band went on hiatus, during which Taylor and Root spent most of their time with Slipknot, who were another up-and-coming act in Des Moines and would soon earn a record deal. Root actually did not join the band until over a year after Taylor, and Economaki went on to become Stage left guitar tech. Joel Ekman had originally parted ways with Stone Sour in 2006 to take care of his son, Isaac James Ekman who had been diagnosed with cancer.",

Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop (1996), No. 4 (1999) and Shangri-La Dee Da (2001) before separating in 2003, after which the band members partook in various projects, most notably Velvet Revolver and Army of Anyone. STP eventually reconvened in 2008 for a reunion tour, released a new self-titled album in 2010, and have been actively touring since.\n\nWhile initially displaying a sound typically identified as grunge early on in its career, further releases from the band have shown a variety of influences, including psychedelic rock, bossa nova and classic rock. The band's evolution throughout the 1990s and early 2000s involved several tumultuous periods of commercial highs and lows, brought about in part by Weiland's well-publicized struggles with drug addiction.",

He is a member of Hip Hop group D-Block, which includes Jadakiss and Sheek Louch. He is known primarily for the hardcore lyrics and powerful messages in his music.\n\nBorn in Corona, Queens, and raised on Groshon Ave in Yonkers, NY, Styles began rapping with Jadakiss and Sheek in 1994, as they all grew up in the same Yonkers, New York neighborhood. They eventually signed to Bad Boy Records, formed the rap group called “THE LOX” which stands for “Living Off Xperience”, and recorded songs with Notorious B.I.G., Sean Combs and Darren Blackburn. In 1998, The Lox released Money, Power & Respect w/ the hit song “Money, Power, Respect” feat. fellow Bad Boy, “Lil Kim” and Ruff Ryder Earl “DMX” Simmons. Soon thereafter, Styles P led the Lox on the now infamous quest to leave Bad Boy Records. When they were finally released, the Lox signed to Interscope. Shortly thereafter, a new Lox album and Jadakiss’ solo album Kiss Tha Game Goodbye were released.\n\nStyles released A Gangster and a Gentleman in 2002, as his debut solo album. The album contained the song “The Life”, featuring Pharoahe Monch which was originally recorded for Rawkus Records’ Soundbombing 3 compilation album. The follow up hit was the song dedicated to marijuana use, “Good Times (I Get High)”, one of the most played songs of 2002.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Sublime was an American ska punk band from Long Beach, California, formed in 1988. The band's line-up, unchanged until their breakup, consisted of Bradley Nowell (vocals and guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Bud Gaugh (drums and percussion). Michael 'Miguel' Happoldt also contributed on a few Sublime songs, such as \"New Thrash.\" Lou Dog, Nowell's dalmatian, was the mascot of the band. Nowell died of a heroin overdose in 1996 and Sublime immediately split up.\n\nSublime released three studio albums, one live album, five compilation albums (one of which also contains never-before released material), three EPs and one box set. Although their first two albums-40 Oz. to Freedom (1992) and Robbin' the Hood (1994)-were quite popular in the United States, Sublime did not experience major commercial success until 1996 with their self-titled third album, released shortly after Nowell's death, which peaked at number 13 on the Billboard 200, and spawned the single \"What I Got\", which remains the band's only number one hit single (on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart) in their musical career. The self-titled album is now considered a classic ska/punk/root reggae album with hip hop influences by fans and critics. As of 2009, the band has sold over 17 million albums worldwide, including about 10 million in the U.S. alone. The band has been credited, for reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States during the mid-1990s.\n\nIn 2009, the surviving members decided to reform the band with Rome Ramirez to bring back the band with a similar vocality that they had with Bradley. However, not long after performing at Cypress Hill's Smokeout Festival, a Los Angeles judge banned the new lineup from using the Sublime name. This was because Nowell had owned rights to the Sublime name, and as a result, they were not allowed to use it without approval and permission from his estate. In January 2010, the lawsuit was settled and the new lineup now performs together as Sublime with Rome, who released their debut album Yours Truly on July 12, 2011. On December 10, 2011, just before playing at the annual KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas, Bud Gaugh announced that it would be his last show with Sublime With Rome.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Supertramp are a British rock band formed in 1969 under the name Daddy before renaming themselves in early 1970. Though their music was initially categorised as progressive rock, they have since incorporated a combination of traditional rock and art rock into their music. The band's work is marked by the inventive songwriting of Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson and the distinctive voice of Hodgson. Supertramp were also well known for their prominent use of the Wurlitzer electric piano and saxophone.\n\nWhile the band's early work was mainstream progressive rock, they would enjoy greater critical and commercial success when they incorporated more conventional and radio-friendly elements into their work in the mid-1970s, going on to sell more than 60 million albums. They reached their peak of commercial success with 1979's Breakfast in America, which has sold more than 20 million copies.\n\nThough their albums were generally far more successful than their singles, Supertramp did enjoy a number of major hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including \"Dreamer\", \"Bloody Well Right\", \"Give a Little Bit\", \"The Logical Song\", \"Breakfast in America\", \"Goodbye Stranger\", \"Take the Long Way Home\", \"It's Raining Again\" and \"Cannonball\". The band attained significant popularity in the United States, Canada, most of Europe, South Africa, Australia, and Brazil. Since Hodgson's departure in 1983, founder Rick Davies has led the band by himself.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Marc Bolan founded Tyrannosaurus Rex in August 1967. After a solitary performance as a four-piece at the Electric Garden in Covent Garden, the group immediately broke up. Bolan retained the services of percussionist Steve Peregrin Took and the duo began performing acoustic material with occasional homages to Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran. The combination of Bolan's acoustic guitar and distinctive vocal style with Took's bongos and assorted percussion-which often included children's instruments such as the Pixiphone-earned them a devoted following in the thriving hippy underground scene. BBC Radio One Disc jockey John Peel championed the band early in their recording career. Peel later appeared on record with them, reading stories written by Bolan. Another key collaborator was producer Tony Visconti, who went on to produce the band's albums well into their second, glam rock phase.\n\nBy 1968, Tyrannosaurus Rex had become a modest success on radio and on record, and had released three albums. While Bolan's early material was rock and roll-influenced pop music, by now he was writing dramatic and baroque songs with lush melodies and surreal lyrics filled with Greek and Persian mythology as well as creations of his own. The band became regulars on Peel Sessions on BBC radio, and toured Britain's student union halls.\n\nBy 1969 there was a clear rift between the two halves of Tyrannosaurus Rex. While Bolan and his girlfriend June Child were living a quiet life, Took had fully embraced the anti-commercial/community-spirited/drug-taking ethos of the UK Underground scene centred around Ladbroke Grove. Took was also attracted to anarchistic elements such as Mick Farren/Deviants and members of the Pink Fairies Rock 'n' Roll and Drinking Club.\n\nTook then contributed his talents and two songs to Twink's Think Pink album, and began writing his own songs, and wanted the duo to perform them, but Bolan strongly disapproved of his solo efforts. Bolan's relationship with Took ended after Unicorn, although they were contractually obliged to go through with a US tour which was doomed before it began. Poorly promoted and planned, the acoustic duo were overshadowed by the loud electric acts they were billed with. To counter this, Took drew from the shock rock style of Iggy Pop; Took explained, \"I took my shirt off in the Sunset Strip where we were playing and whipped myself till everybody shut up. With a belt, y'know, a bit of blood and the whole of Los Angeles shuts up. 'What's going on, man, there's some nutter attacking himself on stage.' I mean, Iggy Stooge had the same basic approach.\"\n\nAs soon as he returned to the UK, Bolan replaced Took with percussionist Mickey Finn. They made A Beard of Stars, the final album under the Tyrannosaurus Rex moniker. Unlike Took, Finn had no songwriting aspirations; Tony Visconti commented he was not as talented as Took: \"Mickey wasn't as inventive as Steve. Mickey's backing vocals weren't strong, so Marc would double-track them with his own voice for reinforcement\"\n\nAs well as progressively shorter titles, Tyrannosaurus Rex's albums began to show higher production values, more accessible songwriting from Bolan, and experimentation with electric guitars and a true rock sound. The breakthrough was \"King of the Rumbling Spires\" (recorded with Took), which used a full rock band. The group's next album, T. Rex, continued the process of simplification by shortening the name, and completed the move to electric guitars. Visconti supposedly got fed up with writing the name out in full on studio chits and tapes and began to abbreviate it; when Bolan first noticed he was angry but later claimed the idea was his. The new sound was more pop-oriented, and the first single, \"Ride a White Swan\", reached number two in the UK in late 1970. In early 1971, T. Rex reached the top 20 of the UK albums chart.\n\"Ride a White Swan\" was quickly followed by a second single, \"Hot Love\", which reached the top spot on the UK charts, and remained there for six weeks. A full band, which featured bassist Steve Currie and drummer Bill Legend, was formed to tour to growing audiences, as teenagers began replacing the hippies of old. After Chelita Secunda added two spots of glitter under Bolan's eyes before an appearance on Top of the Pops, the ensuing performance would often be viewed as the birth of glam rock. After Bolan's display, glam rock would gain popularity in the UK and Europe during 1971-72. T. Rex's move to electric guitars coincided with Bolan's more overtly sexual lyrical style and image. The group's new image and sound outraged some of Bolan's older hippie fans, who branded him a \"sell-out\". Some of the lyrical content of Tyrannosaurus Rex remained, but the fairy tales about wizards and magic were now interspersed with sensuous grooves, replete with orgiastic moans and innuendo.\n\nIn September 1971, T. Rex released their second album Electric Warrior, which featured Currie and Legend. Often considered to be their best album, the chart-topping Electric Warrior brought much commercial success to the group; publicist BP Fallon coined the term \"T. Rextasy\" as a parallel to Beatlemania to describe the group's popularity. The album included T. Rex's best-known song, \"Get It On\", which hit number one in the UK. In January 1972 it became a top ten hit in the US, where the song was retitled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\" to distinguish it from a 1971 song by the group Chase. Along with David Bowie's early hits, \"Get It On\" was among the few British glam rock songs that were successful in the US. However, the album still recalled Bolan's acoustic roots with ballads such as \"Cosmic Dancer\" and the stark \"Girl\". Soon after, Bolan left Fly Records; after his contract had lapsed, the label released the album track \"Jeepster\" as a single without his permission. Bolan went to EMI, where he was given his own record label in the UK-T. Rex Records, the \"T. Rex Wax Co.\".\n\nOn 18 March 1972, T. Rex played two shows at the Empire Pool, Wembley, which were filmed by Ringo Starr and his crew for Apple Films. A large part of the second show was included on Bolan's own rock film Born to Boogie, while bits and pieces of the first show can be seen throughout the film's end-credits. Along with T. Rex and Starr, Born to Boogie also features Elton John, who jammed with the friends to create rocking studio versions of \"Children of the Revolution\" and \"Tutti Frutti\"; Elton John had appeared on TV with Bolan before, miming the piano part of \"Get it On\" on the 1971 Christmas edition of Top of the Pops.\n\nT. Rex's third album The Slider was released in July 1972. The band's most successful album in the US, The Slider was not as successful as its predecessor in the UK, where it peaked at the fourth spot. During spring/summer 1972, Bolan's old label Fly released the chart-topping compilation album Bolan Boogie, a collection of singles, B-sides and LP tracks, which affected The Slider's sales. Two singles from The Slider, \"Telegram Sam\" and \"Metal Guru\", became number one hits in the UK. Born to Boogie premiered at the Oscar One cinema in London, in December 1972. The film received negative reviews from critics, while it was loved by fans.\n\nMarc Bolan and his girlfriend Gloria Jones spent the evening of 15 September 1977 drinking at the Speakeasy and then dining at Morton's club on Berkeley Square, in Mayfair, Central London. While driving home early in the morning of 16 September, Jones crashed Bolan's purple Mini 1275GT into a tree (now the site of Bolan's Rock Shrine), after failing to negotiate a small humpback bridge near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride, Barnes, southwest London, a few miles from his home at 142 Upper Richmond Road West in East Sheen. While Jones was severely injured, Bolan was killed in the crash, two weeks before his 30th birthday.\n\nAfter Bolan, whose death ended the band, three other band members met untimely ends: Steve Peregrin Took died from asphyxiation from a cocktail cherry after his throat was numbed from his use of morphine and magic mushrooms in 1980, Steve Currie also died in a car crash, in 1981; Mickey Finn succumbed to illness in 2003.",

The band comprised David Byrne, Chris Frantz, Tina Weymouth and Jerry Harrison. Auxiliary musicians also regularly made appearances in concert and on the group's albums. The New Wave style of Talking Heads combined elements of punk, art rock, avant-garde, pop, funk, world music, and Americana. Frontman and songwriter David Byrne contributed whimsical, esoteric lyrics to the band's songs, and emphasized their showmanship through various multimedia projects and performances.\nCritic Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes Talking Heads as being \"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s, while managing to earn several pop hits.\" In 2002, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of the band's albums appeared on Rolling Stone magazine's 2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and the Channel 4 100 Greatest Albums poll listed one album (Fear of Music) at number 76.

Along with Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton, she is credited with having defined the role of women in country music during the 1970s.\nWynette's marriage to country music singer George Jones in 1969, which ended in divorce in 1975, created a country music \"couple\", following the earlier success of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Theodore \"Teddy\" DeReese Pendergrass, Sr. (born March 26, 1950 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, died January 13, 2010) was an American Grammy nominated R&B soul singer-songwriter. Pendergrass' career began when he was a drummer for The Cadillacs, who soon merged with fellow soul band Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes. After a stellar early 70s run including the Grammy-nominated hit If You Don't Know Me By Now, Teddy went solo in 1976. He released a total of fifteen solo studio albums including hits like Love T.K.O.. A car accident in 1982 damaged  his spinal cord and left him paralyzed from the waist down with limited use of his arms.   His initial rise to stardom occurred under tutelage of producer's Kenny Gamble & Leon Huff on the then CBS subsidiary Philadelphia International in 1970. The Blue Notes had hits such as \"I Miss You,\" \"Bad Luck,\" \"Wake Up Everybody,\" the two million seller \"If You Don't Know Me By Now\" and many more. Following personality conflicts between Melvin and Pendergrass, Pendergrass launched a solo career and released hit singles like \"The More I Get the More I Want,\" \"Close the Door,\" \"I Don't Love You Anymore,\" \"Turn Off the Lights\" and others.  His first solo album was self titled Teddy Pendergrass (1977), followed by Life Is A Song Worth Singing (1978), Live! Coast To Coast and Teddy (1979), 1980's TP and the final Philadelphia International Records album It's Time For Love (1981). He also sang a duet with Whitney Houston on \"Hold Me,\" from her self-titled debut album.  Teddy Pendergrass started singing gospel music in Philadelphia churches, becoming an ordained minister at ten years old. While attending public school, he sang in the citywide McIntyre Elementary School Choir and in the All-City Stetson Junior High School Choir. A self-taught drummer, Pendergrass had a teen pop vocal group when he was 15.  By his late teens, Pendergrass was a drummer for local vocal group the Cadillacs. In the late 60s, the Cadillacs merged with another more-established group, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes. In 1970, when the Blue Notes broke up, Melvin, now aware of Pendergrass' vocal prowess, asked him to take the lead singer spot. It's no secret that Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff wanted Marvin Junior of the Dells for their Philadelphia International Records roster. Since the Dells were signed to Chess, they were unavailable. When the gruff'n'ready vocals of Pendergrass came their way, they eagerly signed the group.   Beginning with \"I Miss You,\" a steady stream of hit singles flowed from the collaboration of Pendergrass and Gamble & Huff: \"If You Don't Know Me By Now,\" \"The Love I Lost,\" \"Bad Luck,\" \"Wake Up Everybody\" (#1 R&B for two weeks in 1976), and two gold albums, To Be True and Wake Up Everybody.   Unfortunately, the more success the group had, the more friction developed between Melvin and Pendergrass. Despite the revised billing of the group, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes featuring Theodore Pendergrass, Pendergrass felt that he wasn't getting enough recognition. Around 1976, Pendergrass left Melvin's Blue Notes and formed his own Blue Notes, featuring Teddy Pendergrass. Briefly, there was some confusion as to which Blue Notes was which. The resolution came when Pendergrass disbanded his Blue Notes in favor of a solo career and Melvin's group signed a recording contract with Source Records, distributed through ABC Records, scoring a hit with \"I Want to Be Your Lover.\"  Pendergrass signed a new contract with Philadelphia International Records sometime between late 1976 and early 1977. He burst back on the scene with Teddy Pendergrass, a platinum solo debut that included the top-notch singles \"I Don't Love You Anymore,\" \"You Can't Hide From Yourself,\" and \"The More I Get the More I Want.\" Around this time, Pendergrass began to institute his infamous \"Ladies Only\" concerts. His next three albums went gold or platinum: Life Is a Song Worth Singing, Teddy, and Live! Coast to Coast. The hit single \"Close the Door\" was used in the film Soup for One, where Pendergrass had a minor role.   The singer received several Grammy nominations during 1977 and 1978, Billboard's 1977 Pop Album New Artist Award, an American Music Award for best R&B performer of 1978, and awards from Ebony magazine and the NAACP. He was also in consideration for the lead in the movie biopic The Otis Redding Story. The '70s ended, but Pendergrass kept racking up the hits. TP, his fifth solo album, went platinum in the summer of 1980 off the singles \"Turn Off the Lights,\" \"Come Go With Me,\" \"Shout and Scream,\" \"It's You I Love,\" and \"Can't We Try.\" It's Time for Love gave Pendergrass another gold album in summer 1981, which included the hit singles \"Love TKO\" and \"I Can't Live Without Your Love.\" However in the UK chart success was limited to a handful of singles peaking just short of the top 40. Amazingly \"Love TKO\" failed to even grace the top 100.  A 1982 car accident left Pendergrass paralyzed from the waist down and wheelchair-bound. After almost a year of physical therapy and counseling, Pendergrass returned to the recording scene, signing a contract with Elektra/Asylum in 1983. His ninth solo album, his Elektra/Asylum debut, Love Language went gold the spring of 1984. Philadelphia International issued two albums of unreleased tracks, This One's For You (1982) and Heaven Only Knows (1983). Other albums included Workin' It Back (1985), Joy (1988, whose title track stayed at #1 in the R&B charts  for two weeks), and A Little More Magic (1993). The latter half of '90s found Pendergrass recording for the Surefire/Wind Up label. Truly Blessed (the name of an 1991 Elektra album) is the title of the autobiography Pendergrass co-authored with Patricia Romanowski.   Pendergrass passed away at age 59 on January 13, 2010 from complications following surgery for colon cancer.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Testament is an American thrash metal band from Berkeley, California. Formed in 1983 under the name Legacy, the band's current lineup comprises guitarists Eric Peterson and Alex Skolnick, lead vocalist Chuck Billy, drummer Gene Hoglan, and bassist Steve Di Giorgio. Testament has experienced many lineup changes over the years, with Peterson being the only remaining original member, though they have since been rejoined by one of its songwriters Skolnick, who was out of the band from 1992 to 2005. Billy replaced original singer Steve \"Zetro\" Souza (who left the band to join Exodus as the replacement of Paul Baloff) in 1986, prior to the recording of their first studio album, The Legacy, and has been a member of the band since. He and Peterson are the only members to appear on all of Testament's studio albums, with the latter being the only constant member overall.\n\nLabeled as one of the \"big six\" of the 1980s Bay Area thrash metal scene (along with Exodus, Death Angel, Lååz Rockit, Forbidden and Vio-lence), Testament is often credited as one of the most popular and influential bands of the thrash metal scene, as well as one of the leaders of the second wave of the genre in the late 1980s. They have also been referred to as one of the \"big eight\" of thrash metal, along with Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Exodus, Overkill and Death Angel. The band has sold over 1.4 million albums in the United States since the beginning of the SoundScan era and over 14 million copies worldwide. To date, Testament has released thirteen studio albums (one of which is a collection of re-recorded songs), four live albums, five compilation albums, twelve singles and three DVDs.\n\nAfter signing to Atlantic Records in 1986, and changing their name from Legacy to Testament, they released their debut album The Legacy in 1987, followed a year later by The New Order (1988); both albums were acclaimed by critics and the press, including heavy metal-related publications. The band achieved mainstream popularity with its third album Practice What You Preach (1989), which was Testament's first album to climb up the Top 100 on the Billboard 200 chart. A string of more successful albums were released during the early-to-mid-1990s, including Souls of Black (1990), The Ritual (1992) and Low (1994), with the first two also entering the Top 100 on the Billboard 200 chart. After Atlantic dropped the band in 1995, Testament (who had at this point had begun to experiment with a death metal-influenced sound) continued to record and perform until their temporary hiatus in 2001, when Billy was diagnosed with cancer. By 2005, his cancer was in remission and Testament had resumed activity, which briefly saw a reunion of The Legacy lineup and member changes in the interim. Since Skolnick's return to the band, Testament has experienced a resurgence of popularity, with two of their studio albums—Dark Roots of Earth (2012) and Brotherhood of the Snake (2016)—entering the Top 20 on the Billboard 200, and they have continued to tour consistently. The band released their latest studio album, Titans of Creation, on April 3, 2020. They are working on new material for their next studio album as of 2021.",

Born in Waxahachie, Texas, Tevin Campbell had a passion for singing at a young age. He began by singing gospel, first as a choir member, and then as a soloist at Jacob's Chapel in a small town just south of Dallas, Texas.\n\nIn 1988, a friend of Campbell's mother arranged for him to audition for jazz flutist Bobbi Humphrey by singing over the phone to her in New York. Humphrey took an interest in Campbell and submitted an audio and videotape to Warner Bros. This led to a meeting with Benny Medina, the Warner's senior vice president and general sales manager of black music.\n\nCampbell was introduced to the R&B world by Quincy Jones in August 1989. Campbell's debut single was \"Tomorrow (A Better You Better Me)\" which reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip hop Singles chart in June 1990. This was a vocal version of a 1976 instrumental by The Brothers Johnson. It was the lead single from Jones' critically acclaimed ensemble LP Back on the Block which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1991. After working with Jones and writers and producers including Siedah Garrett, Campbell worked with producers Narada Michael Walden, Al B. Sure, Babyface, and others to record additional music.\n",

They have released four EPs, Facedown, Sex, Music for Cars and IV.\nMatthew Healy (b. April 8, 1989) is the son of Denise Welch and Tim Healy and grew up in Newcastle and Manchester. He met Ross MacDonald, Adam Hann and George Daniel at Wilmslow High School near Manchester as teenagers and began to play music in 2004. The band formed when the local council worker organised a number of gigs for teenagers. Healy found Hann who \"came up to me and said he wanted to play one of these shows\". The band began by playing a number of covers until they \"eventually wrote a song. We started from then and we've been making music together since we were about 15.\" according to Healy. After Hann invited the members to form a band, they passed their early days covering punk songs in a local club. Healy was originally the drummer, but took over vocals after the previous singer left to start another band. George Daniel was recruited as the new drummer to complete the final line-up.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Allman Brothers Band is an American rock/blues band once based in Macon, Georgia. The band was formed in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1969 by brothers Duane Allman (slide guitar and lead guitar) and Gregg Allman (vocals, organ, songwriting), who were supported by Dickey Betts (lead guitar, vocals, songwriting), Berry Oakley (bass guitar), Butch Trucks (drums), and Jai Johanny \"Jaimoe\" Johanson (drums). While the band has been called the principal architects of Southern rock, they also incorporate elements of blues, jazz, and country music, and their live shows have jam band-style improvisation and instrumental songs.\n\nThe band achieved its artistic and commercial breakthrough in 1971 with the release of At Fillmore East, featuring extended renderings of their songs \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\" and \"Whipping Post\" and often considered one of the best live albums ever made. George Kimball of Rolling Stone magazine hailed them as \"the best damn rock and roll band this country has produced in the past five years.\" A few months later, group leader Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident. The group survived that and the death of bassist Oakley in another motorcycle accident a year later; with replacement members Chuck Leavell and Lamar Williams, the Allman Brothers Band achieved its peak commercial success in 1973 with the album Brothers and Sisters and the hit single \"Ramblin' Man\". Internal turmoil overtook the band soon after; the group dissolved in 1976, reformed briefly at the end of the decade with additional personnel changes, and dissolved again in 1982.\n\nIn 1989, the group reformed with some new members and has been recording and touring since. A series of personnel changes in the late 1990s was capped by the departure of Betts. The group found stability during the 2000s with bassist Oteil Burbridge, Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks, (the nephew of their drummer), serving as its guitarists, and became renowned for their month-long string of shows in New York City each spring. The band has been awarded eleven gold and five platinum albums between 1971 and 2005.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Animals were an English band of the 1960s, formed in Newcastle upon Tyne during the early part of the decade. The band moved to London on finding fame in 1964. The Animals were known for their gritty, bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their signature song and transatlantic No.1 hit single, \"The House of the Rising Sun\", as well as by hits such as \"We Gotta Get out of This Place\", \"It's My Life\", and \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\". The band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-oriented album material. They were known in the US as part of the British Invasion.\n\nThe Animals underwent numerous personnel changes in the mid-1960s and suffered from poor business management. Under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals, the much-changed act moved to California and achieved commercial success as a psychedelic and hard rock band with hits like \"San Franciscan Nights\", \"When I Was Young\" and \"Sky Pilot\", before disbanding at the end of the decade. Altogether, the group had ten Top Twenty hits in both the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe original lineup had brief comebacks in 1975 and 1983. There have been several partial regroupings of the original era members since then under various names. The Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Band was an acclaimed and influential roots rock group. The original group consisted of Rick Danko (bass guitar, double bass, fiddle, trombone, vocals), Levon Helm (drums, mandolin, guitar, vocals), Garth Hudson (keyboard instruments, saxophones, trumpet), Richard Manuel (piano, drums, baritone saxophone, vocals) and Robbie Robertson (guitar, vocals). All five members were notable musicians in their own right.\nThe members of the Band first came together as they joined rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins's backing group, The Hawks, one by one between 1958 and 1963. Upon leaving Hawkins in 1964, they were briefly known as the Levon Helm Sextet with sax player Jerry Penfound being the sixth member, then Levon and the Hawks after Penfound's departure. In 1965, they released a single on Ware Records under the name Canadian Squires, but returned as Levon and the Hawks for a recording session for Atco later in 1965. At about the same time, Bob Dylan recruited Helm and Robertson for two concerts, then the entire group for his U.S. tour in 1965 and world tour in 1966. Dylan continued to collaborate with The Band over the course of their career, including the informal 1967 recordings that became The Basement Tapes and a joint 1974 tour.\nBecause they were always \"the band\" to various frontmen, Helm said the name \"The Band\" worked well when the group came into its own and left Saugerties, New York, to begin recording their own material. But Alan Livingston, who, as president of EMI records signed them in 1968, claims that he came up with their name when no one could think of what to call them. They recorded two of the most acclaimed albums of the late 1960s: their 1968 debut Music from Big Pink (featuring the single \"The Weight\") and 1969's The Band. In 2004, \"The Weight\" was ranked the 41st best song of all time in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.\nThe Band broke up in 1976, officially ending their touring career with an elaborate live ballroom performance featuring numerous musical celebrities. This performance was immortalized in Martin Scorsese's 1978 documentary The Last Waltz. The Band reformed in 1983 without guitarist Robbie Robertson, who had found success with a solo career and as a Hollywood music producer. The reformed Band were recorded live in concert at Vancouver's Queen Elizabeth Theatre that year, assisted by four extra musicians; It has been released as The Band Reunion and The Band is Back. Following a 1986 show, Richard Manuel was found dead of suicide. However, The Band continued to tour and record albums until the death of Rick Danko in 1999, when the group broke up for good. Levon Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998, and after a series of treatments was able to regain use of his voice. He continued to perform and released several successful albums until he succumbed to the disease 19 April 2012.\nThe group was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked them #50 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and in 2008, they received the Grammy's Lifetime Achievement Award.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Beach Boys are an American rock band, formed in 1961 in Hawthorne, California. The group initially comprised brothers Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. They were managed early on by the Wilsons' father, Murry. The band's leader, composer, arranger and producer, Brian Wilson was responsible for writing most of the band's early singles and albums. After signing with Capitol Records in mid-1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits including \"Surfin' Safari\", \"Surfin' USA\", \"Surfer Girl\", \"Little Deuce Coupe\", \"Be True to Your School\", \"In My Room\", \"Fun, Fun, Fun\", \"I Get Around\", \"Dance Dance Dance\", \"Help Me Rhonda\" and \"California Girls\". These songs and their accompanying albums were internationally popular, making The Beach Boys one of the biggest acts of their time. The band's early music gained popularity across the United States for its close vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a Southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. By the mid-1960s, Brian's growing creative ambition and songwriting ability would dominate the group's musical direction. The primarily Brian-composed Pet Sounds album and \"Good Vibrations\" single (both released in 1966) featured a complex, intricate and multi-layered sound.\nHowever, Brian would soon lose control of the band because of problems with his mental health and substance abuse. This led to the cancellation of the anticipated follow up to Pet Sounds, Smile. Subsequently, although they released a number of highly artistic albums (in various musical styles, with different line-ups) in ensuing years, particularly in the years 1967-1973, the group never managed to reclaim its mid-1960s peak when The Beach Boys challenged The Beatles both in terms of commercial and critical appeal. Since the 1980s, there has been much legal wrangling among the group members over royalties, songwriting credits, and use of the band's name. Following the release of their studio album, Stars and Stripes Vol. 1, in 1996, a number of versions of the band, each fronted by a surviving member of the original quintet (Dennis and Carl Wilson died in 1983 and 1998, respectively), continued to tour until the announcement in late 2011 of a full-scale reunion, including Brian, for 2012 along with the band's twenty-ninth studio album That's Why God Made the Radio, released on June 5, 2012.\nThe Beach Boys have often been called \"America's Band\", and Allmusic has stated that \"the band's unerring ability... made them America's first, best rock band.\" The group has had 36 US Top 40 hits (the most by an American rock band) and 56 Hot 100 hits, including four number-one singles. Rolling Stone magazine listed The Beach Boys at number 12 on its 2004 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time,\" the highest ranking for an American rock band. The group is also one of America's best-selling acts, having sold over 100 million albums worldwide since their debut in 1961. Brian Wilson, Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson, Mike Love, and Al Jardine were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Since the 1990s many of the group's later albums and singles have been re-evaluated by critics and fans with albums such as Sunflower (1970), Surf's Up (1971) and the finally released Smile (1967) albums being seen as worthy successors to their earlier output.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960, becoming one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed acts in the history of popular music. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon (rhythm guitar/vocals), Paul McCartney (bass guitar/vocals), George Harrison (lead guitar/vocals), and Ringo Starr (drums/vocals). Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the group later utilised many genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements, in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\nAs a five-piece line-up of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison on guitar and vocals, with Stuart Sutcliffe (bass), and Pete Best (drums), the band built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Sutcliffe left the group in 1961, and Best was replaced by Starr the following year. They were moulded into a professional act by manager Brian Epstein, and their musical potential was enhanced by the creativity of producer George Martin. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first single, \"Love Me Do\", became a modest hit in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. The band toured extensively around the world until August 1966, when they performed their final commercial concert. From 1966 they produced what many critics consider to be some of their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Revolver (1966), Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (1968), and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, the ex-Beatles each found success in individual musical careers. Lennon was murdered in 1980, and Harrison died of cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain active.\nThe Beatles are the best-selling band in history, with sales of over one billion units estimated by EMI Records. They have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act. According to the RIAA, as of 2012 they have sold 177 million units in the US, more than any other artist, and in 2008 they topped Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists. As of 2012, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with 20. They have received 7 Grammy Awards from the American National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and 15 Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. They were collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people.",

The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a pop act in the late 1960s/early 1970s, and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the late 1970s.\nThe group sang three-part tight harmonies that were instantly recognisable; Robin's clear vibrato lead was a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the late 1970s and 1980s. The brothers wrote all of their own hits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists.\nBorn in the Isle of Man to English parents, the Gibb brothers lived their first few years in Chorlton, Manchester, England, then moved in the late 1950s to Redcliffe, Queensland, Australia, where they began their music careers. After achieving their first chart success in Australia with \"Spicks and Specks\" (their 12th single), they returned to the United Kingdom in January 1967 where producer Robert Stigwood began promoting them to a worldwide audience.\nIt has been estimated that the Bee Gees' career record sales total more than 220 million, ranking them among the best-selling music artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997; the presenter of the award to \"Britain's first family of harmony\" was Brian Wilson, historical leader of the Beach Boys, a \"family act\" also featuring three harmonising brothers. The Bee Gees' Hall of Fame citation says \"Only Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks and Paul McCartney have outsold the Bee Gees\".\nFollowing Maurice's unexpected death in January 2003, Barry and Robin retired the group's name after 45 years of activity. In 2009, however, Robin announced that he and Barry had agreed that the Bee Gees would re-form and perform again. Robin died in May 2012 after a prolonged bout of cancer.",

The follow-up, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, reached the top of the Billboard 200 in 1992.\n\nAfter a hiatus between 2002 and 2005, the band released Warpaint, which hit number 5 on the Billboard chart. After the release of a double album, the greatest hits-like and mostly acoustic Croweology in August 2010, the band started a 20th anniversary tour that was followed by an ongoing second hiatus.\n\nThe band has opened for various rock acts such as Heart, Robert Plant, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Dave Matthews Band, the Grateful Dead, Aerosmith and ZZ Top, and performed live with Jimmy Page and Oasis, among others.

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Black Keys are an American rock duo formed in Akron, Ohio, in 2001. The group consists of Dan Auerbach (guitar, vocals) and Patrick Carney (drums). The duo began as an independent act, recording music in basements and self-producing their records, before they eventually emerged as one of the most popular garage rock artists during a second wave of the genre's revival in the 2010s. The band's raw blues rock sound draws heavily from Auerbach's blues influences, including Junior Kimbrough, Howlin' Wolf, and Robert Johnson.\nFriends since childhood, Auerbach and Carney founded the group after dropping out of college. After signing with indie label Alive, they released their debut album, The Big Come Up (2002), which earned them a new deal with Fat Possum Records. Over the next decade, the Black Keys built an underground fanbase through extensive touring of small clubs, frequent album releases and music festival appearances, and substantial licensing of their songs. Their third album, Rubber Factory (2004), received critical acclaim and boosted the band's profile, eventually leading to a record deal with major label Nonesuch Records in 2006. After self-producing and recording their first four records in makeshift studios, the duo completed Attack & Release (2008) in a professional studio and hired producer Danger Mouse, a frequent collaborator with the band.\nThe group's commercial breakthrough came in 2010 with Brothers, which along with its popular single \"Tighten Up\", won three Grammy Awards. Their 2011 follow-up El Camino received strong reviews and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 chart, leading to the first arena concert tour of the band's career, the El Camino Tour. The album and its hit single \"Lonely Boy\" won three Grammy Awards. In 2014, they released their eighth album, Turn Blue, their first number-one record in the US, Canada, and Australia.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Byrds were an American rock band, formed in Los Angeles, California in 1964. The band underwent multiple line-up changes throughout its existence, with frontman Roger McGuinn (aka Jim McGuinn) remaining the sole consistent member until the group disbanded in 1973. Although they only managed to attain the huge commercial success of contemporaries like The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and The Rolling Stones for a short period of time (1965-66), The Byrds are today considered by critics to be one of the most influential bands of the 1960s. Initially, they pioneered the musical genre of folk rock, melding the influence of The Beatles and other British Invasion bands with contemporary and traditional folk music. As the 1960s progressed, the band was also influential in originating psychedelic rock, raga rock, and country rock. In addition, the band's signature blend of clear harmony singing and McGuinn's jangly twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar has continued to be influential on popular music up to the present day. Among the band's most enduring songs are their cover versions of Bob Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and Pete Seeger's \"Turn! Turn! Turn! (to Everything There is a Season)\", along with the self-penned originals, \"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\", \"Eight Miles High\", \"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\", \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" and \"Chestnut Mare\".\nThe original five-piece line-up of The Byrds consisted of Jim McGuinn (lead guitar, vocals), Gene Clark (tambourine, vocals), David Crosby (rhythm guitar, vocals), Chris Hillman (bass guitar, vocals), and Michael Clarke (drums). However, this version of the band was relatively short-lived and by early 1966, Clark had left due to problems associated with anxiety and his increasing isolation within the group. The Byrds continued as a quartet until late 1967, when Crosby and Clarke also departed the band. McGuinn and Hillman decided to recruit new members, including country rock pioneer Gram Parsons, but by late 1968, Hillman and Parsons had also exited the band. McGuinn, who by this time had changed his name to Roger after a flirtation with the Subud religion, elected to rebuild the band's membership and between 1968 and 1973, he helmed a new incarnation of The Byrds, featuring guitarist Clarence White among others. McGuinn disbanded the then current line-up in early 1973, to make way for a reunion of the original quintet. The Byrds' final album was released in March 1973, with the reunited group disbanding soon afterwards.\nSeveral ex-members of the band went on to have successful careers of their own, either as solo artists or as part of groups, such as Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, The Flying Burrito Brothers and The Desert Rose Band. In the late 1980s, Gene Clark and Michael Clarke both began touring as The Byrds, prompting a legal challenge from McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman over the rights to the band's name. As a result of this, McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman performed a series of reunion concerts as The Byrds in 1989 and 1990, and also recorded four new Byrds' songs. In January 1991, The Byrds were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, an occasion that saw the five original members performing together for the last time. McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman still remain active but Gene Clark died of a heart attack in 1991, and Michael Clarke died of liver failure in 1993.",

The band originated in Boston, Massachusetts, with lead singer and rhythm guitarist Ric Ocasek, lead singer and bassist Benjamin Orr, guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson. They were signed to Elektra Records by George Daly, then A&R head, in 1977.\nThe Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synth-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flower in the early 1980s. The Cars started fresh with their debut album The Cars which went on to go platinum in late 1978. The Cars' debut album was called a \"genuine rock masterpiece\" by Allmusic. The most successful and well known song from the album, \"Just What I Needed\", started as a demo in 1977. The song was sent as a mix tape to a local DJ in the Boston area, who played the song in heavy rotation. This soon caught the attention of other DJs, which led to the signing of the band by Elektra Records in 1977.\nThe band broke up in 1988, and Ocasek had always discouraged talk of a reunion since then, telling one interviewer in 1997 \"I'm saying never and you can count on that.\" Bassist Benjamin Orr died in 2000 from pancreatic cancer. In 2005, Easton and Hawkes joined with Todd Rundgren to form a spin-off band, The New Cars, which performed classic Cars and Rundgren songs alongside new material. The surviving original members reunited in 2010 to record a new album, titled Move Like This, which was released May 10, 2011, and a tour to start on the same day.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Chemical Brothers are an English electronic music duo composed of Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons. Originating in Manchester in 1991, along with The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, and fellow acts, they were pioneers at bringing the big beat genre to the forefront of pop culture.\nEd Simons was born in Herne Hill, South London on 9 June 1970 to a barrister mother and a father who was not around much when Simons was growing up. Simons' two main interests when he was young were aeroplanes and musicals. Simons attended two South London public schools, Alleyn's School and Dulwich College. During his school years, he developed a fondness for rare groove and Hip hop music, having frequented a club called The Mud Club from the age of 14. By the time he left school, his two main musical interests were two Manchester bands, New Order and The Smiths. After finishing school with 11 O levels and three A-levels, he continued on to study history, especially late medieval history, at the University of Manchester.\nTom Rowlands, a childhood classmate of Simons', was born on 11 January 1971 in Kingston upon Thames, London. When Rowlands was very young, his family relocated to Henley-on-Thames. He later attended Reading Blue Coat School in Berkshire, during which time he became obsessed with Scotland, developing a fondness for the bagpipes in particular. In his early teens, his interest in music broadened to other genres. Initially, some of his favourites included the Oh What a Lovely War soundtrack, 2 Tone, the nascent gothic rock genre (Sisters of Mercy, Fields of the Nephilim) and the electro sounds of artists such as Kraftwerk, New Order, Cabaret Voltaire, and Heaven 17. He described the first Public Enemy album as the record that probably changed his life, and commented that \"Miuzi Weighs a Ton\" was one of the most amazing tracks he had ever heard. Rowlands also started collecting hip hop records by artists like Eric B and Schoolly D. Rowlands left school with similar accomplishments to Simons', achieving nine O levels and three A levels. For university, he followed Simons to Manchester primarily to immerse himself in its music scene in general and the Haçienda in particular.\nRowlands was also in a band called Ariel prior to meeting up with Simons. Ariel was formed in London by Rowlands and his friends Brendan Melck and Matt Berry. Their first single was \"Sea of Beats\", which was essentially a white label. Before Philip Brown set up Echo Logik Records, their first promo was \"Bokadilo\". Other songs, released on 12\", included \"Mustn't Grumble\" and their most well-known, \"Rollercoaster\". After a year on Echo Logik they signed to the record label deConstruction. They insisted that they get a female singer and they recruited former Xpansions frontwoman Sally Ann Marsh, and after some disappointing songs like \"Let It Slide\" (Rowlands would later describe it as \"a stinker\") the band fell apart. One of the last things Ariel did was the song \"T Baby\" which was remixed by the pair.\nRowlands and Simons then started to DJ at a club called \"Naked Under Leather\" in the back of a pub in 1992 under the alias of \"The 237 Turbo Nutters\" (named after the number of their house on Dickenson Road in Manchester and a reference to their Blackburn raving days). The pair would play hip hop, techno, and house.",

Headon left the group in 1982, and internal friction led to Jones's departure the following year. The group continued with new members, but finally disbanded in early 1986.\n\nThe Clash achieved commercial success in the United Kingdom with the release of their debut album, The Clash, in 1977. Their third album, London Calling, released in the UK in December 1979, brought them popularity in the United States when it came out there the following month. It was declared the best album of the 1980s a decade later by Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nThe Clash's politicised lyrics, musical experimentation and rebellious attitude had a far-reaching influence on rock, alternative rock in particular. They became widely referred to as \"The Only Band That Matters\", originally a promotional slogan introduced by the group's record label, CBS. In January 2003, the band-including original drummer Terry Chimes-were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The band consists of vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan and drummer Fergal Lawler. Although widely associated with alternative rock, the band's sound also incorporates indie pop, post-punk, Irish folk and pop rock elements.\n\nThe Cranberries rose to international fame in the 1990s with their debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, which became a commercial success and sold over five million copies in the United States. The group was one of the most successful rock acts of the '90s and sold over 15 million albums in the United States alone. The band has achieved four top 20 albums on the Billboard 200 chart (Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?; No Need to Argue; To the Faithful Departed and Bury the Hatchet) and eight top 20 singles on the Modern Rock Tracks chart (\"Linger\", \"Dreams\", \"Zombie\", \"Ode to My Family\", \"Ridiculous Thoughts\", \"Salvation\", \"Free to Decide\" and \"Promises\").\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus, The Cranberries reunited and began a North American tour, followed by dates in Latin America and Europe in early 2010. The band recorded their sixth album, Roses, in May 2011, and released it on 27 February 2012.\n\nin 1989, brothers Mike (bass) and Noel (guitar) Hogan formed The Cranberry Saw Us with drummer Fergal Lawler and singer Niall Quinn, in Limerick, Ireland. Less than a year later, Quinn left the band. The remaining band members then placed an advertisement for a female singer. Dolores O'Riordan responded to the advertisement and auditioned by writing lyrics and melodies to some existing demos. When she returned with a rough version of \"Linger\", the group hired her.\n\nAfter hiring O'Riordan, the band started recording a home-made demo tape, of which 300 copies were sold. Changing their name to The Cranberries, the band sent another demo tape, which featured early versions of both \"Linger\" and \"Dreams,\" to record companies throughout the UK. The tape was recorded at the Xeric studios, which was run by Pearse Gilmore, who would later become their manager.\n\nThe demo tape earned the attention of both the UK press and record industry and sparked a bidding war between major British record labels. Eventually, the group signed with Island Records. The Cranberries headed back into studio with Gilmore as their producer to record their first EP, \"Uncertain.\" The title proved to be prophetic as they did sound ill at ease, leading to poor reviews in the press. This led to tension between the group and Gilmore. After a disastrous recording sessions intended for their first Island records album in January 1992, the band scrapped their work and fired Gilmore. After hiring Geoff Travis as their new manager, The Cranberries headed back into studio in Dublin in March 1992 to restart working on their first LP with Stephen Street, who had previously worked with The Smiths.\n\nDuring that time period, The Cranberries toured in Ireland and the UK, getting the attention of the British press. The band also recorded several studio and live sessions intended for Irish and British radio and television shows, including 2fm's The Dave Fanning Show and BBC Radio 1's John Peel Show.",

The band fuse a \"heavy metal revivalist\" sound with the \"pseudo-mysticism ... of The Doors  the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin ... while adding touches of post-punk goth rock\". Since their earliest form in Bradford during 1981, the band have had various line-ups; the longest-serving members are vocalist Ian Astbury and guitarist Billy Duffy, the band's two songwriters.\nAfter moving to London, the band released the album Love in 1985, which charted at No. 4 in the United Kingdom, and which included singles such as \"She Sells Sanctuary\" and \"Rain\". In the late 1980s, the band dropped their post-punk sound in favour of hard rock with their third album, Electric; the polish on this new sound was facilitated by Rick Rubin, who produced the record. Their fourth album, Sonic Temple, proceeded in a similar vein, and these two LPs enabled them to break into the North American market. By the early 1990s, the band were fraying behind the scenes, due to alcohol abuse and off-stage tensions, leading to a split-up in 1995. The band reunited in 1999 and recorded the album Beyond Good and Evil, and they reissued all of their albums in Asia and Eastern Europe in 2003 and Japan in 2004. In 2006, the band reformed again to perform a series of worldwide tours. In October 2007, the band released the album Born into This, on the Roadrunner Records label. In July 2009, Astbury announced that The Cult would not record or produce any more studio albums, focusing on EPs and Digital Releases instead for new material, though he subsequently changed his mind and declared that there would be another album in the near future. Their ninth studio album, entitled Choice of Weapon, was released on 22 May 2012.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Cure are an English alternative rock band formed in Crawley, West Sussex in 1976. The band has experienced several line-up changes, with frontman, vocalist, guitarist and principal songwriter Robert Smith being the only constant member. The Cure first began releasing music in the late 1970s with its debut album Three Imaginary Boys (1979); this, along with several early singles, placed the band as part of the post-punk and New Wave movements that had sprung up in the wake of the punk rock revolution in the United Kingdom. During the early 1980s, the band's increasingly dark and tormented music helped form the gothic rock genre.\n\nAfter the release of Pornography (1982), the band's future was uncertain and Smith was keen to move past the gloomy reputation his band had acquired. With the 1982 single \"Let's Go to Bed\" Smith began to place a pop sensibility into the band's music (as well as a unique stage look). The Cure's popularity increased as the decade wore on, especially in the United States where the songs \"Just Like Heaven\", \"Lovesong\" and \"Friday I'm in Love\" entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart. By the start of the 1990s, The Cure were one of the most popular alternative rock bands in the world. The band is estimated to have sold 27 million albums as of 2004. The Cure have released thirteen studio albums, 10 EPs and over thirty singles during the course of their career. Since 2010, they have been working on a fourteenth studio album.",

Richard Daniels one of the founding members would be drafted just before the groups first major success.\n\nSoon, they became known throughout the Philadelphia area, signing with Cameo Records. At Cameo, Stan Watson introduced them to the man who made them famous, producer Thom Bell, then working with Chubby Checker. Bell dreamed of creating a Philadelphia version of Motown and struck gold with the Delfonics, whose first album, released on Watson’s own Philly Groove record label, featured the hit “La-La (Means I Love You)”, in 1968. Four more Bell-produced albums appeared in the next few years: The Sexy Sound of Soul, The Delfonics Super Hits, The Delfonics and Tell Me This Is a Dream. Among the Delfonics’ popular hits were “Didn’t I (Blow Your Mind This Time)”, “For the Love I Give to You”, “Ready or Not Here I Come (Can’t Hide from Love)” and “Hey Love”. Prior to the release of “La-La (Means I Love You)”, they had a hit with “He Don’t Really Love You” on the small Moonshot label. ",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Doors were an American rock band formed in 1965 in Los Angeles, California, with vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, drummer John Densmore and guitarist Robby Krieger. The band took its name from Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, the title of which was a reference to a William Blake quotation: \"If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.\" They were among the most controversial rock acts of the 1960s, due mostly to Morrison's wild, poetic lyrics and charismatic but unpredictable stage persona. After Morrison's death in 1971, the remaining members continued as a trio until finally disbanding in 1973.\n \nThey were signed to Elektra Records in 1966. The 1967 release of The Doors was the first in a series of top ten albums in the US, followed by Strange Days (1967), Waiting for the Sun (1968), The Soft Parade (1969), Morrison Hotel (1970), Absolutely Live (1970) and L.A. Woman (1971), with 19 Gold, 14 Platinum and 5 Multi-Platinum album awards in the United States alone. Although The Doors' active career ended in 1973, their popularity has persisted. According to the RIAA, they have sold 32.5 million certified units in the US. The band has sold 100 million albums worldwide. Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger continue to tour as Manzarek-Krieger or Ray Manzarek & Robby Krieger of The Doors for legal issues, performing Doors songs exclusively. The Doors were the first American band to accumulate eight consecutive gold LPs. In 1993, The Doors were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",

They were originally formed to serve as backing group for Clyde McPhatter (of Billy Ward & the Dominoes) in 1953.\nRolling Stone magazine states that the Drifters were the least stable of the vocal groups due to being low-paid hired musicians under the direct control of their management, headed by George Treadwell, who owned the Drifters name. The Treadwell Drifters website states that there have been 60 vocalists in the history of the Treadwell Drifters line. Several splinter groups by former Drifters members (not under Treadwell's management) add to the count. These splinter groups are usually identified with a possessive credit such as \"Bill Pinckney's Original Drifters\", \"Charlie Thomas' Drifters\", etc. Only one splinter Drifters group features a classic Drifters member, Charlie Thomas' Drifters. Nevertheless, there are two versions of the Drifters that are notable. The first classic Drifters formed by Clyde McPhatter was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame as \"The Drifters\" or \"The Original Drifters\". The second Drifters formed by Treadwell featuring Ben E. King was separately inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame as Ben E. King and the Drifters. In their induction, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame eclectically selected four members from the classic Drifters, two from the second Drifters, and one from the post-King Treadwell Drifters.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Flying Burrito Brothers were a country rock band which formed in 1968 in Los Angeles, California, United States. The band’s original lineup consisted of Chris Hillman (vocals, guitar), Gram Parsons (vocals, guitar), Chris Ethridge (piano, bass) and Sneaky Pete Kleinow (pedal steel guitar). Later members of from the band’s initial existence included Eddie Hoh (drums), Jon Corneal (drums), Bernie Leadon (guitar, vocals), Michael Clarke (drums) and Rick Roberts (vocals, guitar). The group originally disbanded in 1972 following Hillman’s departure.\n\nKleinow and Ethridge instigated a reformation of the band in 1975 which continued through 1984. The band was reformed once again in 1985 and were disbanded for a final time in 2001.\n\nThe band best known as the “Flying Burrito Brothers” actually ‘borrowed’ their name from the original “Flying Burrito Brothers”, composed of bassist Ian Dunlop and drummer Mickey Gauvin, bandmates of Parsons from the Boston-based International Submarine Band, plus any of a loose coalition of musicians, including Parsons himself from time to time. In a deliberate choice of focusing on just creating and playing music without the distractions of the music industry, in 1968 the original Brothers moved from Los Angeles to New York City. From this base they continued to tour the Northeast playing their eclectic traditional/rockabilly/blues/R&B-oriented version of rock, using the name “The Flying Burrito Brothers East” after Parsons’ group became famous.\n\nMeanwhile, on the West Coast, Parsons and guitarist/mandolinist/bassist/vocalist Chris Hillman thought this same moniker would be perfectly suited to the band they had been dreaming of since early 1968, when, as members of Roger McGuinn’s band The Byrds, they created one of the first country-oriented rock albums, Sweetheart of the Rodeo. They immersed themselves in their vision in their house in the San Fernando Valley, dubbed “Burrito Manor”, even replacing their wardrobe with a set of custom country-Western suits from tailor to the C&W stars, Nudie’s Rodeo Tailors (Parsons’s had marijuana leaf embroidery) and began a period of intensely fruitful creativity. At this juncture, the band also included pianist/bassist Chris Ethridge and pedal steel guitarist “Sneaky” Pete Kleinow.\n\nTheir first album The Gilded Palace of Sin (1969) did not sell terribly well, being a radical departure from anything most of the record-buying public (either rock or country) had ever seen, but the group had a cult following which included several famous musicians, such as Bob Dylan and The Rolling Stones. Parsons soon became friends with Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones and left the group after 1970’s Burrito Deluxe, which also saw the departure of Ethridge and addition of guitarist/dobro player/vocalist Bernie Leadon and drummer Michael Clarke (of The Byrds). Rick Roberts replaced Parsons and released a self-titled album with the group in 1971. Kleinow then left to become a session musician and Leadon joined The Eagles. Al Perkins and Roger Bush replaced them, and Kenny Wertz and Byron Berline joined as well, releasing The Last of the Red Hot Burritos (1972), a live album. The band fell apart. Hillman and Perkins joined Manassas, while Berline, Bush and Wertz formed Country Gazette. Roberts reassembled a new group for a 1973 European tour, and then began a solo career before forming Firefall with Michael Clarke.\n\nAs Gram Parsons’s influence and fame grew, so did interest in the Flying Burrito Brothers, leading to the release of Honky Tonks (1974), a double album, and the recreation of the band by Kleinow and Ethridge in 1975. Floyd “Gib” Gilbeau, Joel Scott Hill and Gene Parsons (no relation to Gram) also joined, and the band released Flying Again that year. Ethridge was then replaced by Skip Battin for Airborne (1976), followed by an album of unreleased early material, Sleepless Nights. For the next few decades, the group released albums and toured and had a country hit with “White Line Fever” (1980, a cover by Merle Haggard) and then became the Burrito Brothers. Headed by prolific songwriter and ace guitarist John Beland and Gib Guilbeau, and normally featuring Sneaky Pete, this incarnation scored moderately well on the Country charts in the early 1980s. Through numerous incarnations (including Brian Cadd for a time), the band released albums and toured throughout the 1980s up till 2001 when John Beland “officially” ended FBB. While the bands work during the 1980-1999 period was exceptional, after 1984 none of the many releases had any chart impact. Sneaky created a Burritos spinoff in his new band Burrito Deluxe, which featured Carlton Moody on lead vocals and Garth Hudson from The Band on keyboards. While a good band, there has never been any real continuity with the true Burritos and this group can not be considered anything more than a spinoff. Pete however, left the band due to illness in 2005, leaving no direct lineage to the original masters.\n\nGram Parsons died on September 19, 1973. “Sneaky Pete” Kleinow died on January 6, 2007. Chris Hillman is still a very successful singer-songwriter, having been part of Souther-Hillman-Furay, McGuinn-Clark-Hillman, then going on to form the Desert Rose Band (1986-1993) with Herb Pedersen. He still sings with Pedersen today as Chris and Herb, having released “The Other Side” (2005).",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Fray is an American piano rock band from Denver, Colorado. Formed in 2002 by schoolmates Isaac Slade and Joe King, they achieved success with the release of their debut album, How to Save a Life in 2005, which was certified double platinum by the RIAA and platinum in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. The Fray achieved national success with their first single, \"Over My Head (Cable Car)\", which became a top ten hit in the United States. The release of their second single, \"How to Save a Life\", brought the band worldwide fame. The song charted in the top three of the Billboard Hot 100 and was a top 5 single in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\nThe group's second self-titled album, released in 2009, debuted at number-one on the Billboard charts and was certified gold in the United States, Australia and Canada. It was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album in 2010. While both the albums were commercially successful, critical reception was mixed. The Fray was ranked No. 84 on Billboard's \"Artists of the Decade\" list.\nThe Fray's use of the piano as the lead instrument in their music has led critics to compare the band with English piano-driven bands like Coldplay and Keane. However, the band lists its influences as The Wallflowers, Counting Crows, Better Than Ezra and U2.\nThe band members' lives were largely formed in Denver churches where they helped lead worship, and in the Christian school three of them attended. Slade, 24, and guitarist Joe King, 25, were several years ahead of drummer Ben Wysocki, 21, at Faith Christian Academy. Wysocki and guitarist David Welsh, 27, played in the same worship band. In the spring of 2002, former schoolmates Isaac Slade and Joe King reconnected and began regular two-man jam sessions that led to writing songs. Isaac and Joe later added Zach Johnson on drums and Slade's younger brother Caleb on bass, though Caleb was later asked to leave. Caleb's departure from the band caused a rift in his relationship with Isaac and this rift later became the inspiration for the song \"Over My Head (Cable Car)\", which is about the brothers' wanting relationship. Following this Johnson left the band as well to attend an art school in New York.\nBen Wysocki, a former bandmate of Isaac Slade, joined as drummer and later, Dave Welsh, who was another former band mate of Slade and Wysocki, was added as lead guitarist to the band. The newly formed band was named \"The Fray\". The band members decided on a name after asking people to put band names on a piece of paper. They ended up picking \"The Fray\" randomly. The members of the band first claimed that they found the name suitable because they frequently quarreled about the composition of the lyrics in their songs, but they have since stated they are usually on good terms while composing music and acknowledges contributions from all of its members. The band has had no permanent bassist since Caleb, instead employing touring bassists on a temporary basis. The current bassist is Jeremy McCoy, who has been with the band since 2009.\nThe band released its first record, Movement EP in 2002. The next year, the band released Reason EP produced by How To Save A Life co-producer Aaron Johnson, which garnered the band local fame and acclaim. Westword, an alternative newsweekly, gave Reason EP a positive review, stating \"The music is epic, no doubt, but it's played on a wholly human scale\". Despite these reviews, the band struggled to launch a single; Denver radio station KTCL rejected eight of their songs before the band decided to submit a demo of \"Cable Car\". The song found airplay on a KTCL radio show highlighting local bands, and the radio station received a large number of requests for it soon thereafter. The band changed the name of the song to \"Over My Head (Cable Car)\", and as the song's airplay increased alongside their local following, the band was voted \"Best New Band\" by Westword in 2004. Epic Records A&R man Daniel Davis discovered the band through the article in Westword and soon after, Epic Records officially signed the band on December 17, 2004.",

Inductees into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, The Impressions are best known for their 1960s string of hits, many of which were heavily influenced by gospel music and served as inspirational anthems for the Civil Rights Movement.

After singing in a number of local gospel groups, the two of them joined a doo-wop group called \"The Roosters\" in 1957, whose members included Chattanooga, Tennessee natives Sam Gooden, Richard Brooks, and his brother Arthur Brooks. By 1958, The Roosters had a new manager in Eddie Thomas, a record deal with Vee-Jay Records, and a new name: \"Jerry Butler & the Impressions\". \nThe group's first hit single was 1958's \"For Your Precious Love\", which hit #11 on the US pop charts and #3 on the R&B charts. However, soon after the release of the R&B Top 30 hit \"Come Back My Love\", Butler left the group to go on to a successful solo career. After briefly touring with the now-solo Butler as his guitarist, Curtis Mayfield became the group's new lead singer and songwriter, and Fred Cash, a returning original Roosters member, was appointed as the new fifth member. \n\nABC-Paramount Records success:\nMayfield wrote a number of Butler's early solo hits, and used the money to get The Impressions to move to Chicago, Illinois. There, they got a new deal with ABC-Paramount Records in 1961, and released their first post-Butler single. That single, \"Gypsy Woman\", was their biggest single to date, hitting #2 on the R&B charts and #20 on the pop chart. Successive singles failed to match \"Gypsy Woman\"′s success, and Richard and Arthur Brooks ended up leaving the group in 1962. \nThe Impressions returned to Chicago as a trio, and soon aligned themselves with producer Johnny Pate, who helped to update their sound and create a more lush soul sound for the group. The result was \"It's All Right\", a 1963 million-selling gold single that topped the R&B charts and made it to #4 on the pop charts, and became one of the group's signature songs. \"It's All Right\" and \"Gypsy Woman\" were the anchors of The Impressions' first LP, 1963's The Impressions. \n1964 brought the first of Mayfield's Black pride anthem compositions, \"Keep on Pushing\", which became a Top 10 smash on both the Billboard Pop and R&B charts, peaking at #10 Pop. It was the title cut from the album of the same name, which also reached the Top 10 on both charts. Future Mayfield compositions would feature an increasingly social and political awareness, including the following year's major hit and the group's best-known song, the gospel-influenced \"People Get Ready\", which hit #3 on the R&B charts and #14 on the pop charts. \n\nIncreasing social consciousness:\nIn the mid-1960s, The Impressions were compared with Motown acts such as The Temptations, The Miracles, and The Four Tops. After 1965's \"Woman's Got Soul\", and the #7 pop hit \"Amen\", The Impressions failed to reach the R&B Top Ten for three more years, finally scoring in 1968 with the #9 \"I Loved and Lost\". \"We're a Winner\", which hit #1 on the R&B charts that same year, represented a new level of social awareness in Mayfield's music. Mayfield created his own label, Curtom, and moved The Impressions to the label. Over the next two years, more Impressions message tracks, including the #1 R&B hit \"Choice of Colors\" (1969) and the #3 \"Check Out Your Mind\" (1970), became big hits for the group. \nThe Impressions were a notable influence on Bob Marley and The Wailers and other ska/rocksteady groups and singers in Jamaica: The Wailers modelled their singing/harmony style on them and in part borrowed their look, too. There are many covers of Impressions songs by The Wailers, including \"Keep On Moving\", \"Long Long Winter\" and \"Just Another Dance\". Pat Kelly covered \"Soulful Love\", The Heptones covered \"I've Been Trying.\" No doubt the social consciousness of Curtis Mayfield's lyrics appealed as well as the spectacular harmonies. \n\nAfter Mayfield's departure:\nAfter the release of the Check Out Your Mind LP in 1970, Mayfield left the group and began a successful solo career, the highlight of which was writing and producing the Super Fly soundtrack. After his success with this soundtrack, he collaborated on the soundtracks of Claudine, Sparkle, and A Piece of the Action. He continued to write and produce for The Impressions, who remained on Curtom. Leroy Hutson was the first new lead singer for the group following Mayfield's departure, but success eluded The Impressions, and Hutson left the group in 1973.Jon French was the drummer for the tourning band playing around the United States and Europe. He is also heard on the recording of \"Freddie's Dead\" \n,  \n\nLater years, awards, and accolades:\nNew members Ralph Johnson and Reggie Torian replaced Hutson, and The Impressions had three R&B Top 5 singles in 1974-1975: the #1 \"Finally Got Myself Together (I'm a Changed Man)\" (which also reached the Pop top 20 ), and the #3 singles \"Same Thing it Took\" and \"Sooner or Later\". In 1976, The Impressions left Curtom and Mayfield behind for Cotillion Records, and had their final major hit with \"Loving Power\". The same year, Ralph Johnson was replaced by Nate Evans, who remained in the group for three years, during which time The Impressions switched to 20th Century Records. Singles and albums sales continued to slip, and Evans left in 1979, reducing the group to a trio. The album Fan the Flames was released in 1981. \nReggie Torian left in 1983. Ralph Johnson rejoined that year, as well as new member Vandy Hampton. This lineup recorded with Eric Clapton on his Reptile album. \nThe Impressions were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, and into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2003. The members who got to take part in this honor, as Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees, were the original Roosters/Impressions lineup: Sam Gooden, Jerry Butler, Richard Brooks, Curtis Mayfield, Arthur Brooks, and Fred Cash. \nJohnson left in 2001, was replaced by Willie Kitchens. This lineup was featured on the PBS specials R&B 40 and Soul and Inspiration. Hampton was released in 2003; he died in 2005. Reggie Torian later returned, replacing Kitchens. The Impressions recorded a tribute album to Curtis Mayfield in 2000, which was released by Edel America. In 2008, Universal Music & Hip O Records released Movin' On Up - the first-ever video compilation of The Impressions, featuring brand-new interviews with original Impressions members Sam Gooden and Fred Cash, along with taped interviews with the late Curtis Mayfield and video performances of the group's greatest hits and several of Mayfield's solo hits. The group's first million-selling hit song \"For Your Precious Love\", featuring original lead singer Jerry Butler on lead, is ranked #327 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time),and their hit People Get Ready is ranked #24 on that same list. Also, The Impressions' album/CD The Anthology 1961-1977 is ranked at #179 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. \nTheir 1965 hit song \"People Get Ready\" has also been chosen as one of the Top 10 Best Songs Of All Time by a panel of 20 top industry songwriters and producers, including Paul McCartney, Brian Wilson, Hal David, and others, as reported to Britain's Mojo music magazine. \n\nReemergence:\nIn July 2013, The Impressions released \"Rhythm!,\" their first single in over thirty years, on Daptone Records. The 7\" record featured original members Fred Cash, Sam Gooden, and Reggie Torrian and was produced by Binky Griptite, guitarist for The Dap Kings. \"Rhythm!\" was originally penned by Curtis Mayfield in the mid-sixties. The B-Side, \"Star Bright,\" was written by Binky Griptite. \n, \nIn August 2013, former Impressions member Leroy Hutson filed a complaint against Young Jeezy and others alleging that Young Jeezy's song \"Time\" inappropriately incorporated the instrumental portion of The Impressions \"Getting it On,\" which was registered with the United States Copyright Office in 1973.  \n\nPersonnel:\nFor a detailed listing of the various versions of the group, see Impressions chronology. \nJerry Butler (1958-1960), \nCurtis Mayfield (1958-1970), \nSam Gooden (1958-present), \nArthur Brooks (1958-1962), \nRichard Brooks (1958-1962), \nFred Cash (1960-present), \nLeroy Hutson (1970-1973), \nRalph Johnson (1973-1976;1983-2000), \nVandy Hampton (1983-2003), \nNate Evans (1976-1979), \nReggie Torian (1973-83;200?-present), \nGary Underwood (1992-2001), \nFred Dave",

The founding members of the band were Ronald Isley, older brothers Rudy and Kelly and younger brother Vernon. Originally formed as a gospel quartet, following the death of brother Vernon, the remaining trio launched a career into doo-wop scoring with their first million-selling hit single, \"Shout\", in 1959. Follow-up successes came with the 1962 single, \"Twist and Shout\" and the 1966 Motown single, \"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)\".\nFollowing the release of their 1969 Grammy Award winning hit, \"It's Your Thing\" and subsequent other hits on their own label, the family eventually grew to include younger brothers Ernie and Marvin Isley as well as brother-in-law Chris Jasper. From 1973 until 1983, the group would release a successive string of hit albums and singles on the R&B charts, becoming one of the few successful black groups to successfully cross over into the pop charts due to their mixture of soul, funk and rock thanks to the albums, 3 + 3 and The Heat Is On and also helped pioneer the quiet storm format with a string of ballads on their 1970s and 1980s albums.\nSince then, the group has gone through different lineup changes becoming one of the few acts to have successfully charted a single or an album in five decades. The group has been awarded with accolades including inductions to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame as well as the R&B Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Jam were an English punk rock/New Wave/mod revival band active during the late 1970s and early 1980s. They were formed in Woking, Surrey. While they shared the \"angry young men\" outlook and fast tempos of their punk rock contemporaries, The Jam wore smartly tailored suits rather than ripped clothes, and they incorporated a number of mainstream 1960s rock and R&B influences rather than rejecting them, placing The Jam at the forefront of the mod revival movement.\n\nThey had 18 consecutive Top 40 singles in the United Kingdom, from their debut in 1977 to their break-up in December 1982, including four number one hits. As of 2007, \"That's Entertainment\" and \"Just Who Is the 5 O'Clock Hero?\" remained the best-selling import singles of all time in the UK. They released one live album and six studio albums, the last of which, The Gift, hit number one on the UK album charts. When the group split up, their first 15 singles were re-released and all placed within the top 100.\n\nThe band drew upon a variety of stylistic influences over the course of their career, including 1960s beat music, soul, rhythm and blues and psychedelic rock, as well as 1970s punk and new wave. The trio was known for its melodic pop songs, its distinctly English flavour and its mod image. The band launched the career of Paul Weller, who went on to form The Style Council and later had a successful solo career. Weller wrote and sang most of The Jam’s original compositions, and he played lead guitar, using a Rickenbacker. Bruce Foxton provided backing vocals and prominent basslines, which were the foundation of many of the band’s songs, including the hits \"Down in the Tube Station at Midnight\", \"The Eton Rifles\", \"Going Underground\" and \"Town Called Malice\".",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, by brothers Ray and Dave Davies in 1964. Categorised in the United States as a British Invasion band, The Kinks are recognised as one of the most important and influential rock acts of the era. Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including rhythm and blues, British music hall, folk and country. Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the group's 32-year run. Original members Pete Quaife (bass guitar, vocals) and Mick Avory (drums and percussion) were replaced by John Dalton in 1969 and Bob Henrit in 1984, respectively. Dalton was in turn replaced by Jim Rodford in 1978. Keyboardist Nicky Hopkins accompanied the band during studio sessions in the mid-1960s. Later, various keyboardists, including John Gosling and Ian Gibbons, were full-time members.\nThe Kinks first came to prominence in 1964 with their third single, \"You Really Got Me\", written by Ray Davies. It became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States. Between the mid-1960s and early 1970s, the group released a string of commercially and critically successful singles and LPs, and gained a reputation for songs and concept albums reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' observational writing style. Albums such as Face to Face, Something Else, The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, Arthur, Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround and Muswell Hillbillies, along with their accompanying singles, are considered among the most influential recordings of the period. The Kinks' subsequent theatrical concept albums met with less success, but the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s-groups such as Van Halen, The Jam, The Knack and The Pretenders covered their songs, helping to boost The Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, Britpop acts such as Blur and Oasis cited the band as a major influence. The Kinks broke up in 1996, a result of the commercial failures of their last few albums and creative tension between the Davies brothers.\nThe Kinks had five Top 10 singles on the US Billboard chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40. In the UK, the group had seventeen Top 20 singles and five Top 10 albums. Four of their albums have been certified gold by the RIAA. Among numerous honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for \"Outstanding Service to British Music\". In 1990, their first year of eligibility, the original four members of The Kinks were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005.",

Formed by Luke Pritchard (vocals/guitar), Hugh Harris (lead guitar), Paul Garred (drums), and Max Rafferty (bass guitar), the lineup of the band remained constant until 2008 and the departure of Rafferty. Dan Logan was drafted in as a temporary replacement, until Peter Denton joined the band on a permanent basis in October 2008. Early in 2010 Pritchard announced the departure of drummer Paul Garred, due to a nerve problem in his arm. Late in the year, Garred rejoined for studio sessions, however Chris Prendergast plays drums when the band play live.\n\nA self-described \"pop\" band, their music is primarily influenced by the 1960s British Invasion movement and post-punk revival of the new millennium. With songs described as \"catchy as hell\", The Kooks have experimented in several genres including rock, Britpop, pop, reggae, and ska, at times being described as \"a less severe Arctic Monkeys\".\n\nSigned to Virgin Records just three months after forming, The Kooks broke into the musical mainstream with their debut album Inside In/Inside Out (2006). The album was ultimately successful, achieving quadruple platinum status in the UK within a year and also overseas in the form of a platinum certification in Australia and two times platinum in Ireland. The Kooks found themselves entering into mainstream media attention, with the band winning the award for Best UK & Ireland Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2006 and picking up a nomination at The Brit Awards for the single \"She Moves in Her Own Way\". With their follow-up Konk (2008) debuting at number one on the UK Albums Chart, it recorded first week sales of 65,000, achieving gold status in both the UK and Ireland. Their third studio album, entitled Junk of the Heart, was released on 12 September 2011.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The National is an indie rock band formed in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1999 and currently based in Brooklyn, New York. The band's lyrics, which have been described as \"dark, melancholy and difficult to interpret\", are written and sung by Matt Berninger, a baritone. The rest of the band is composed of two pairs of brothers: twins Aaron (guitar and keyboard) and Bryce Dessner (guitar) and Scott (bass) and Bryan Devendorf (drums). The National has been compared to Joy Division, Leonard Cohen, Wilco and Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds. The name of the band was chosen because it \"didn't mean anything\" and was \"benign and meaningless\".\nIn 1991, Matt Berninger and Scott Devendorf met while attending the University of Cincinnati, where they also met Mike Brewer, Casey Reas and Jeff Salem. Together, the five of them formed the lo-fi garage band Nancy, named after Berninger's mother, aspiring to sound like Pavement. The band was together for five years, but only released one album, Ruther 3429, on Wife Records before breaking up after Berninger, Devendorf, Reas and Salem moved to Brooklyn.\nBryan, Bryce and Aaron were childhood friends who played in several bands together over the years. When their last effort, Project Nim, broke up in 1998, they joined Matt and Scott in Brooklyn via the Devendorf relationship.\nWhen the band was formed in 1999, it was called The National, although the domain name of the band's website is americanmary.com because, according to Matt Berninger in an interview with Better Propaganda, \"t's a song off our first record. We never thought of changing the (website) name, although we should have.\" Several of the members continued to work day jobs while performing free Sunday night shows regularly at the highly regarded NYC Lower East Side venue, Luna Lounge, throughout the early years, including being involved in New York's dot-com boom in the late 1990s.",

He was also known as Biggie Smalls (after a character in the 1975 film Let's Do It Again) and Frank White (after the main character of the 1990 film King of New York).\nWallace was raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. When Wallace released his debut album Ready to Die in 1994, he became a central figure in the East Coast hip-hop scene and increased New York's visibility at a time when West Coast artists were more common in the mainstream. The following year, Wallace led his childhood friends to chart success through his protégé group, Junior M.A.F.I.A. While recording his second album, Wallace was heavily involved in the East Coast/West Coast hip-hop feud, dominating the scene at the time.\nOn March 9, 1997, Wallace was killed by an unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles. His double-disc set Life After Death, released 15 days later, hit #1 on the U.S. album charts and was certified Diamond in 2000 (one of the few hip hop albums to receive this certification). Wallace was noted for his \"loose, easy flow\", dark semi-autobiographical lyrics and storytelling abilities. Since his death, a further two albums have been released. MTV ranked him at #3 on their list of The Greatest MCs of All Time. He has certified sales of 17 million units in the United States.",

They are widely credited, alongside fellow California pop punk bands Sublime, Green Day, Bad Religion, and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States in the 1990s. Known as Manic Subsidal until 1986, the band consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Dexter Holland, lead guitarist Noodles, bassist Greg K. and drummer Pete Parada. Parada replaced former drummer Adam \"Atom\" Willard in 2007, during the recording of the band's eighth studio album, Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace, and has been a member of the band since.\nThe band's first three albums for the independent record labels Nemesis and Epitaph earned them a following. Their 1994 third studio album Smash became a breakout success and eventually sold over 12 million copies worldwide, setting a record for most albums sold on an independent label. The critical praise given to Smash garnered attention from labels, including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring would sign in 1996. Their first album for Columbia, Ixnay on the Hombre was released in 1997 and was well received by critics. The Offspring continued to achieve success with their three follow-up albums, Americana (1998), Conspiracy of One (2000) and Splinter (2003), reaching multi-platinum, platinum and gold status respectively. Splinter was followed five years later by Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace (2008), which was also successful, due to the album's second single \"You're Gonna Go Far, Kid\" reaching number one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart for 11 weeks and becoming their only gold single in America to date. Their latest studio album, Days Go By, was released on June 26, 2012.\nThe Offspring has sold over 36 million albums worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, and many of their albums have sold over a million units.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Platters were one of the most successful vocal groups of the early rock and roll era. Their distinctive sound was a bridge between the pre-rock Tin Pan Alley tradition and the burgeoning new genre. The act went through several personnel changes, with the most successful incarnation comprising lead tenor Tony Williams, David Lynch, Paul Robi, Herb Reed, and Zola Taylor. The group had 40 charting singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart between 1955 and 1967, including four no. 1 hits. The Platters formed in Los Angeles in 1953 and were initially managed by Ralph Bass. The original group (Alex Hodge, Cornell Gunter, David Lynch, Joe Jefferson, Gaynel Hodge and Herb Reed) managed to land a contract with Federal Records, but found little success. Herb Reed is credited with creating the group's name. In June 1953, Gunter was replaced by lead vocalist Tony Williams. The band then released two singles with Federal Records, under the management of Ralph Bass, but found little success. The band then met music entrepreneur and songwriter Buck Ram. Ram made some changes to the lineup, most notably the addition of female vocalist Zola Taylor; later, Alex Hodge was replaced by Paul Robi. Under Ram's guidance, the Platters recorded eight songs for Federal in the R&B/gospel style, scoring a few minor regional hits on the West Coast, and backed Tony Williams' sister, Linda Hayes, One song recorded during their Federal tenure, \"Only You (And You Alone)\", originally written by Ram for the Ink Spots, was deemed unreleasable by the label, though copies of this early version do exist. Despite their lack of chart success, the Platters were a profitable touring group, successful enough that The Penguins, coming off their #8 single \"Earth Angel\", asked Ram to manage them as well. With the Penguins in hand, Ram was able to parlay Mercury Records' interest into a 2-for-1 deal. To sign the Penguins, Ram insisted, Mercury also had to take the Platters. Ironically, the Penguins would never have a hit for the label.",

For the majority of their history, the band consisted of Sting (lead singer, bassist and principal songwriter), Andy Summers (guitarist) and Stewart Copeland (drummer). The Police became globally popular in the late 1970s and are generally regarded as one of the first new wave groups to achieve mainstream success, playing a style of rock that was influenced by punk, reggae, and jazz. They are also considered one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S. They disbanded in 1986, but reunited in early 2007 for a one-off world tour that ended in August 2008.\nTheir 1978 debut album, Outlandos d'Amour, reached No. 6 in the UK, and their second album Reggatta de Blanc became the first of five consecutive UK No. 1 albums. Synchronicity from 1983 was No. 1 in both the UK and U.S., selling over 8 million copies in the U.S. alone. The Police have sold over 75 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. They were the world's highest-earning musicians in 2008, thanks to their reunion tour.\nThe band has won a number of music awards throughout their career, including six Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards—winning Best British Group once, an MTV Video Music Award, and in 2003 were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of their five studio albums appeared on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

The first settled line-up consisted of Brian Jones on guitar and harmonica, Ian Stewart on piano, Mick Jagger on lead vocals and harmonica, Keith Richards on guitar and backing vocals, Bill Wyman on bass and Charlie Watts on drums. Jones founded and led the band, but Jagger and Richards assumed leadership after becoming the primary songwriters. Jones' increasing physical and mental troubles forced his departure from the band two weeks prior to his drowning death in 1969. Since Wyman retired in 1993, full band members have been Jagger, Richards, Watts and guitarist Ronnie Wood who joined in 1975, replacing Mick Taylor (who had followed Jones). The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted the Rolling Stones in 1989. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them fourth on the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" list and their album sales are estimated at more than 200 million worldwide.\n\nThe Rolling Stones were in the vanguard of the \"British Invasion\" of English bands that became popular in the U.S. in the mid-sixties. They have released twenty-four studio albums, eleven live albums and numerous compilations. Their album Sticky Fingers (1971) began a string of eight consecutive studio albums reaching number one in the United States. Their most recent album of new material, A Bigger Bang, was released in 2005. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked the Rolling Stones at number ten on \"The Billboard Top All-Time Artists\" and as the second most successful group in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nThe Rolling Stones' advent brought greater international recognition to the primitive urban blues typified by Chess Records' artist Muddy Waters, writer of \"Rollin' Stone\", the song for which the band is named. Critic and musicologist Robert Palmer said their endurance and relevance stems from being \"rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music\" while \"more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone\". In 2012 the band celebrated their 50th anniversary.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Shirelles were an African American girl group that achieved popularity in the early 1960s. They consisted of schoolmates Shirley Owens (later Shirley Alston-Reeves), Doris Coley (later Doris Kenner-Jackson), Addie \"Micki\" Harris (later Addie Harris McPherson), and Beverly Lee. They have been described as either the first African-American girl group to top the Billboard Hot 100, or the first girl group overall, with the song \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\".\nFounded in 1957 for a talent show at their high school, they were signed by Florence Greenberg of Tiara Records. Their first single, \"I Met Him on a Sunday\", was released by Tiara and licensed by Decca Records in 1958. After a brief and unsuccessful period with Decca, they went with Greenberg to her newly formed company, Scepter Records. Working with Luther Dixon, the group rose to fame with \"Tonight's the Night\". After a successful period of collaboration with Dixon and promotion by Scepter, with seven top 20 hits, The Shirelles left Scepter in 1966. Afterwards, they were unable to maintain their previous popularity.",

Based on the song writing partnership of Morrissey (vocals) and Johnny Marr (guitar), the band also included Andy Rourke (bass) and Mike Joyce (drums). Critics have called them the most important alternative rock band to emerge from the British independent music scene of the 1980s. The group was signed to the independent record label Rough Trade Records, on which they released four studio albums, several compilations, and numerous non-LP singles. Although they had limited commercial success outside the UK while they were still together, and never released a single that charted higher than number 10 in their home country, The Smiths won a significant following, and remain cult and commercial favourites. The band broke up in 1987 and have turned down several offers to reunite since then.",

These group names were used in the UK to avoid confusion with a British folk group also called The Spinners. In 1954, a group of friends who grew up together in Ferndale, Michigan, a northern suburb bordering Detroit, came together to make music. For a time, several of the band members resided in Detroit's Herman Gardens public housing projects. Billy Henderson, Henry Fambrough, Pervis Jackson, C. P. Spencer, and James Edwards called themselves The Domingoes. However James Edwards lasted only a few weeks. He was replaced by Bobby Smith, who sang lead on most of the Spinners' early records (and many of their biggest Atlantic hits). C. P. Spencer left the group shortly afterwards, and later went on to be a member of the Voice Masters and The Originals. He was replaced by George Dixon. The group renamed themselves The Spinners in 1961. This name was chosen after looking at popular car hubcaps and noting how they spun around on a car's wheel.",

Originally founded as the Primettes in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959, the Supremes' repertoire included doo-wop, pop, soul, Broadway show tunes, psychedelic soul, and disco. They were the most commercially successful of Motown's acts and are, to date, America's most successful vocal group with 12 number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, Holland–Dozier–Holland. At their peak in the mid-1960s, the Supremes rivaled the Beatles in worldwide popularity, and their success made it possible for future African American R&B and soul musicians to find mainstream success.\nFounding members Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson, Diana Ross, and Betty McGlown, all from the Brewster-Douglass public housing project in Detroit, formed the Primettes as the sister act to the Primes (with Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks, who went on to form the Temptations). Barbara Martin replaced McGlown in 1960, and the group signed with Motown the following year as the Supremes. Martin left the act in early 1962, and Ross, Ballard, and Wilson carried on as a trio.\nDuring the mid-1960s, the Supremes achieved mainstream success with Ross as lead singer. In 1967, Motown president Berry Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross & the Supremes, and replaced Ballard with Cindy Birdsong. Ross left to pursue a solo career in 1970 and was replaced by Jean Terrell, at which point the group's name reverted to the Supremes. After 1972, the lineup changed more frequently; Lynda Laurence, Scherrie Payne, and Susaye Greene all became members of the group during the mid-1970s. The Supremes disbanded in 1977 after an 18-year run.",

Six years later, Mandagi met Dundas while the pair worked in a clothing store. In 2005, the three friends decided to form a band, with Mandagi on vocals and guitars, and Dundas on drums, while Aherne was later convinced to join on bass guitar by Mandagi. The Temper Trap rehearsed with a variety of second guitarists before Dundas recommended his former Geelong Grammar schoolmate, Sillitto, on lead guitar. Joseph Greer later became the fifth band member on keyboards and guitar. Lorenzo Sillitto, departed the band in late 2013, to leave the band with its current four piece line-up.\nThe group was named \"The Temper Trap\" after Temper Temper, the trio's first choice, was rejected due to its use by a United States (US) band.",

Known for their recognizable choreography, distinct harmonies, and flashy onstage suits, the Temptations have been said to be as influential to soul as The Beatles are to pop and rock.\nFormed in Detroit, Michigan, in 1960 as The Elgins (not to be confused with another Motown group with the same name), the Temptations have always featured at least five male vocalists/dancers. Having sold tens of millions of albums, the Temptations are one of the most successful groups in music history. As of 2010, the Temptations continue to perform and record for Universal Records with its one living original member, Otis Williams, still in its lineup.\nThe original lineup included members of two local Detroit vocal groups: from The Distants, second tenor Otis Williams, first tenor Elbridge \"Al\" Bryant, and bass Melvin Franklin; and from The Primes, first tenor/falsetto Eddie Kendricks and second tenor/baritone Paul Williams (no relation to Otis). Among the most notable future Temptations were lead singers David Ruffin and Dennis Edwards (both later solo artists), Ali-Ollie Woodson, Ron Tyson, Glenn Leonard, Damon Harris, Richard Street, Theo Peoples, and G. C. Cameron. Like its \"sister\" female group, the Supremes, the Temptations' lineup has changed frequently over the years.\nOver the course of their career, the Temptations have released four Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles and 14 Billboard R&B number-one singles. Their material has earned them three Grammy Awards, while two more awards were conferred upon the songwriters and producers who crafted their 1972 hit \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\". The Temptations were the first Motown act to earn a Grammy Award. Six Temptations (Dennis Edwards, Melvin Franklin, Eddie Kendricks, David Ruffin, Otis Williams, and Paul Williams) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. Three classic Temptations songs, \"My Girl\", \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\", and \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\", are among The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.",

The provocative lyrics of some of the band's songs gave a nihilistic outlook to some of their music.\nTheir 1967 debut album, titled The Velvet Underground & Nico (which featured German singer Nico, with whom the band collaborated) was named the 13th Greatest Album of All Time, and the \"most prophetic rock album ever made\" by Rolling Stone in 2003.

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Verve were an English rock band formed in 1989 in Wigan by lead vocalist Richard Ashcroft, guitarist Nick McCabe, bass guitarist Simon Jones and drummer Peter Salisbury. The guitarist and keyboard player Simon Tong later became a member. Beginning with a psychedelic sound indebted to shoegazing and space rock, by the mid-1990s the band had released several EPs and three albums. It also endured name and line-up changes, breakups, health problems, drug abuse and various lawsuits. Filter referred to them as \"one of the tightest knit, yet ultimately volatile bands in history\". The band's commercial breakthrough was the 1997 album Urban Hymns, one of the best-selling albums in UK Chart history, and the single \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\", which became a worldwide hit. In 1998, the band won two Brit Awards-winning Best British Group, appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine in March, and in February 1999, \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song.\n\nSoon after this commercial peak, The Verve broke up in April 1999, citing internal conflicts. During an eight year split, Ashcroft dismissed talk of a reunion, saying: \"You're more likely to get all four Beatles on stage.\" The band's original line-up reunited in June 2007, embarking on a tour later that year and releasing the album Forth in August 2008. In 2009, the band broke up for the third time.",

He began recording songs under the stage name The Weeknd and uploading them to YouTube in late 2010, though his identity was initially unknown. In March 2011, The Weeknd released a nine-song free album, House of Balloons, which was critically acclaimed. The title track is based on a sample of Siouxsie and the Banshees' hit single \"Happy House.\" The first album is a part of a trilogy which includes Thursday released in August of the same year and Echoes of Silence issued in December. In June, House of Balloons was named as one of ten shortlisted nominees of 2011 Polaris Music Prize but eventually lost to Arcade Fire's The Suburbs. On December 21, 2011 at 11:07 p.m. EST Tesfaye released his highly anticipated third mixtape Echoes of Silence. On June 14, the tape was announced as a nominee for the 2012 Polaris Music Prize, becoming the second mixtape from the trilogy to receive recognition for the award.\nThe Weeknd has received praise from several music publications, including those of Pitchfork, MTV, BET, Rolling Stone, XXL and The Source, who have dubbed him the \"Songbird of his Generation\" and the \"best musical talent since Michael Jackson\" (John Norris, MTV).",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Whispers is an R&B/dance vocal group formed in 1964 in Los Angeles, California. The original members included the twin brothers Scotty and Wallace Scott, along with Gordy Harmon, Marcus Hutson and Nicholas Caldwell. In 1973, Harmon was replaced by former Friends of Distinction member Leaveil Degree. The group scored many hits on the R&B and Billboard Hot 100 charts throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and they hit #1 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart in 1980 with “And the Beat Goes On/Can You Do the Boogie/Out the Box”.\nThe group’s sound was marked by Scotty Scott’s fluid, melodic voice which featured on virtually all of their hits. Scotty’s sound was so distinctive and likeable that, in his heyday, he was as recognizable as such noted R&B lead singers as Ronald Isley of The Isley Brothers.\nIn 1987, they enjoyed a career resurgence when “Rock Steady” hit #1 on the R&B charts, and it became their first Top 10 success on the Hot 100, reaching #7. The Whispers also founded the Black Tie record label.\nIn the 1990s, The Whispers joined the Capitol Records family releasing more favorites. Expanding their creative horizons, brothers Walter and Scotty cut “My Brothers Keeper”, a critically-acclaimed duet album in 1993, scoring another R&B hit with a cover of the Intruders’ “I Wanna Know Your Name.” The 1995 release “Toast to the Ladies” featured a collection of love songs dedicated to women all over the world. In 1997, the group moved to Interscope Records where they featured the works of Baby face once again with their album, “Songbook, Vol. 1: The Songs of Babyface”. Both albums charted on Billboard’s top 100 albums.\nMarcus stopped performing with the group in 1989 due to ill health and the Whispers vowed never to replace him when he died in 2000. In the new millennium, the group still performs around the world to thousands of loyal fans. The group has not made any personnel changes and still consists of Walter Scott, Wallace Scott, Nicholas Caldwell, and Leaveil Degree. They have taken the world by storm, selling out in various casinos and hotels, music venues, and they have a tremendous following throughout the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa. However, they still find time for charity work with youth education, cancer organizations, 100 Black Men, and Domestic violence charities.\nOn September 23, 2003, The Whispers’ four decades of accomplishments were acknowledged when they were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. On June 12, 2005, The San Francisco Chapter of the Grammy Awards presented the Whispers with the prestigious Governors Award, the highest honor bestowed by an Academy Chapter. They were also inducted into the Bay Area Blues Society Hall of Fame in 2006. In 2007, The Black Music Academy of America selected the Whispers to receive their “Living Legends” award.\nThey are one of only a few “old school” groups that can boast of having over 40 years in the industry with a worldwide fan base. The Whispers waited almost a decade to produce a new CD in 2005. This independent product, the first venture of their newly formed corporation Satin Tie Entertainment is a masterpiece entitled, “For Your Ears Only”. According to Walter, “This title was a way of saying to our fans that while we want everyone’s support, we very much want the support of our fans, who have been with us for many, many years.” It made its way up the Billboard chart immediately. In 2007, they release a DVD of their live concert entitled “The Whispers Live From Las Vegas”, the first of its kind. A CD soundtrack of the same concert was also released.\nCAREER HIGHLIGHTS\nSeven Gold Albums, Two Platinum Albums, 12 Top Twenty Singles, 40 Charted Hits Since 1970, Four Decades of Pop & R & B FavoritesAmerican Music Award Nominees, Soul Train Award Nominees, Grammy Award Nominees\n2003 Vocal Group Hall of Fame Inductees, 2005 S.F.

        "strBiographyEN" : "The White Stripes were an American rock duo, formed in 1997 in Detroit, Michigan. The group consisted of the couple, married at the time, Jack White (songwriter, vocals, guitar, bass and keyboards) and Meg White (drums and occasional vocals). After releasing several singles and three albums within the Detroit music scene, The White Stripes rose to prominence in 2002, as part of the garage rock revival scene. Their successful and critically acclaimed albums White Blood Cells and Elephant drew attention from a large variety of media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom, with the single \"Seven Nation Army\" and its now-iconic guitar line becoming a huge hit. The band recorded two more albums, Get Behind Me Satan in 2005 and Icky Thump in 2007, and dissolved in 2011 after a lengthy hiatus from performing and recording.\nThe White Stripes used a low-fidelity approach to writing and recording. Their music featured a melding of garage rock and blues influences and a raw simplicity of composition, arrangement, and performance. The duo was also noted for their fashion and design aesthetic which featured a simple color scheme of red, white, and black—which was used on every album and single cover the band released—as well as the band's fascination with the number three. The band's discography consists of six studio albums, one live album, two extended plays (EP), one concert film, one tour documentary, twenty-six singles, and fourteen music videos. Their last three albums each won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.",

They became known for energetic live performances which often included instrument destruction. The Who have sold about 100 million records, and have charted 27 top forty singles in the United Kingdom and United States, as well as 17 top ten albums, with 18 Gold, 12 Platinum and 5 Multi-Platinum album awards in the United States alone.\nThe Who rose to fame in the UK with a series of top ten hit singles, boosted in part by pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline, beginning in January 1965 with \"I Can't Explain\". The albums My Generation (1965), A Quick One (1966) and The Who Sell Out (1967) followed, with the first two reaching the UK top five. They first hit the US Top 40 in 1967 with \"Happy Jack\" and hit the top ten later that year with \"I Can See for Miles\". Their fame grew with memorable performances at the Monterey Pop, Woodstock and Isle of Wight music festivals. The 1969 release of Tommy was the first in a series of top ten albums in the US, followed by Live at Leeds (1970), Who's Next (1971), Quadrophenia (1973), The Who by Numbers (1975), Who Are You (1978) and The Kids Are Alright (1979).\nMoon died at the age of 32 in 1978, after which the band released two studio albums, the UK and US top five Face Dances (1981) and the US top ten It's Hard (1982), with drummer Kenney Jones, before disbanding in 1983. They re-formed at events such as Live Aid and for reunion tours such as their 25th anniversary tour (1989) and the Quadrophenia tours of 1996 and 1997. In 2000, the three surviving original members discussed recording an album of new material, but their plans temporarily stalled upon Entwistle's death at the age of 57 in 2002. Townshend and Daltrey continue to perform as The Who, and in 2006 they released the studio album Endless Wire, which reached the top ten in the UK and US.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Thin Lizzy are an Irish hard rock band formed in Dublin, Ireland, in 1969. Their music reflects a wide range of influences, including blues, soul music, psychedelic rock, and traditional Irish folk music, but is generally classified as hard rock or sometimes heavy metal.\n\nTwo of the founding members, drummer Brian Downey and bass guitarist and lead vocalist Phil Lynott, met while still in school. Lynott led the group throughout their recording career of twelve studio albums, writing most of the material. The singles \"Whiskey in the Jar\" (a traditional Irish ballad), \"The Boys Are Back in Town\" and \"Waiting for an Alibi\" were international hits. After Lynott's death in 1986, various incarnations of the band emerged over the years based initially around guitarists Scott Gorham and John Sykes, though Sykes left the band in 2009. Gorham later continued with a new line-up including Downey. In 2012, Gorham and Downey decided against recording new material as Thin Lizzy so a new band, Black Star Riders, was formed to tour and produce new releases such as their debut album All Hell Breaks Loose. Thin Lizzy plan to reunite for occasional concerts.\n\nLynott, Thin Lizzy's de facto leader, was composer or co-composer of almost all of the band's songs, and the first black Irishman to achieve commercial success in the field of rock music. Thin Lizzy featured several guitarists throughout their history, with Downey and Lynott as the rhythm section, on the drums and bass guitar. As well as being multiracial, the band drew their early members not only from both sides of the Irish border but also from both the Catholic and Protestant communities during The Troubles.\n\nRolling Stone magazine describes the band as distinctly hard rock, \"far apart from the braying mid-70s metal pack\". AllMusic critic John Dougan has written that \"As the band's creative force, Lynott was a more insightful and intelligent writer than many of his ilk, preferring slice-of-life working-class dramas of love and hate influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and virtually all of the Irish literary tradition.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Anna Mae Bullock (born November 26, 1939), better known by her stage name Tina Turner, is an American singer and actress whose career has spanned more than half a century, earning her widespread recognition and numerous awards. Turner started out her music career with husband Ike Turner as a member of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. Success followed with a string of notable hits including \"River Deep - Mountain High\" (1966) and \"Proud Mary\" (1971). With the publication of her autobiography I, Tina in 1986, Turner revealed severe instances of domestic violence against her by Ike Turner prior to their 1976 split and subsequent 1978 divorce. Turner was raised a Baptist and later converted to the Buddhist faith, crediting the religion and its spiritual chants with giving her the strength she needed to get through difficult times. Following her divorce from Ike Turner, she rebuilt her career by constantly performing, eventually launching another series of hits starting in 1983 with the single \"Let's Stay Together\" and the 1984 release of her fifth solo album Private Dancer. \"What's Love Got to Do with It,\" the most popular single from the album, would later serve as the title of a biographical film about Turner that was adapted from her autobiography.\n\nTurner's musical career has led her to several onscreen roles, the first of which was a prominent turn as The Acid Queen in the 1975 film Tommy and an appearance in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1978). She starred opposite Mel Gibson as Aunty Entity in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) for which she received the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture, and her rendering of the film's theme, \"We Don't Need Another Hero\", was a hit single. She also appeared in the 1993 film Last Action Hero.\n\nOne of the world's most popular entertainers, Turner has been called the most successful female rock artist, and was named \"one of the greatest singers of all time\" by Rolling Stone. Her combined album and single sales total approximately 180 million copies worldwide. She is known for her energetic stage presence, powerful vocals, career longevity, and widespread appeal. In 2008, Turner left semi-retirement to embark on her Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour. Turner's tour became one of the highest selling ticketed shows of 2008-2009. Rolling Stone ranked her at 63 on their 100 greatest artists of all time and considers her the \"Queen of Rock and Roll\".",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Born in Los Angeles, but an Oakland resident by the age of 14, Too Short was the first West Coast rap star, recording three albums on his own before he made his major-label debut with 1988's gold album Born to Mack; his next four all went platinum. Anticipating much of the later gangsta phenomenon, he restricted his lyrical themes to tales of sexual prowess and physical violence, with the occasional social message track to mix things up. After the release of Gettin' It (Album Number Ten) in 1996, Too Short decided to retire, his status assured as one of the most successful solo rappers of the 1980s and early '90s, although that decision would prove short-lived.\n\nLife Is...Too Short\nBorn Todd Shaw on April 28, 1966, Too Short grew up in L.A.'s South Central; soon after his family moved to Oakland in the early '80s, he began selling tapes out of the back of his car. Signed to the local label 75 Girls, in 1983 he released his first proper album, Don't Stop Rappin'. Three albums followed in the next two years, after which Too Short formed his own Dangerous Music label with friend Freddy B. He recorded Born to Mack in 1986, and sold more than 50,000 copies just by riding around the region. New York's Jive Records picked up on the buzz from across the country, and provided a national deal for the album one year later. With virtually no radio airplay, Born to Mack went gold and its follow-up, Life Is...Too Short, achieved platinum sales by 1989.\n\nShort Dog's in the House\nThe immense success of Too Short during 1988-1989 made him much more viable for radio airplay, and \"The Ghetto\" -- from 1990's Short Dog's in the House -- made number 12 on the R&B charts, even enjoying a brief stay just outside the pop Top 40. He continued his hit track record with 1992's Shorty the Pimp and 1993's Get in Where You Fit In, both of which went platinum. By the time of 1995's Cocktails, however, Too Short began to be drowned out by a glut of similar-sounding West Coasters, and though Gettin' It (Album Number Ten) became his fifth platinum album, by late 1996 he decided to retire. Just three years later, however, he returned with the aptly titled Can't Stay Away, which debuted in the Top Ten and went gold. A series of follow-ups surfaced subsequently. In 2006 his high-profile album Blow the Whistle arrived with producers Jazze Pha and Lil Jon contributing. ",

The band emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album Undertow in 1993, and later became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement with the release of their second effort, Ænema, in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued with Lateralus (2001) and the most recent album 10,000 Days (2006), gaining the band critical acclaim and commercial success around the world.\nDue to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and relatively long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock and art rock. The relationship between the band and today's music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship and the band members' insistence on privacy.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Train is an American roots rock band from San Francisco, formed in 1993. The band currently consists of Pat Monahan (vocals), Jimmy Stafford (lead guitar), Jerry Becker (rhythm guitar and piano), Hector Maldonado (bass), Drew Shoals (drums), Nikita Houston (backing vocals) and Sakai Smith (backing vocals).\nWith a lineup that included original members Monahan, Stafford, Scott Underwood, Rob Hotchkiss and Charlie Colin, the band achieved mainstream success with their debut album Train, which was released in 1998 with the hit \"Meet Virginia\". Train's 2001 album, Drops of Jupiter contained the lead single \"Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)\", which won two Grammy Awards in 2002. The album was certified double platinum in the United States and Canada and remains the band's best-selling album to date.\nTrain's third studio album, My Private Nation, released in 2003, was certified platinum in the United States with the hit \"Calling All Angels\". Following the departures of Hotchkiss and Colin, the band released their fourth album, For Me, It's You in 2006, with Brandon Bush (keyboards) and Johnny Colt (bass). Despite a generally positive reception from critics, the album was commercially unsuccessful. Because of this, Train went on a three-year hiatus.\nIn late 2009, Train released the album Save Me, San Francisco, from which the album's three singles—-the RIAA 6x Platinum-certified international hit \"Hey, Soul Sister\", \"If It's Love\" and \"Marry Me\"—-reached high positions on the Billboard Hot 100 at numbers 3, 34, and 34, respectively. The album itself has been certified gold by both the RIAA and ARIA and has sold 954,000 units. Since 2008, Jerry Becker (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) and Hector Maldonado (bass, guitar, percussion, backing vocals) have been touring and recording with the group around the world. In May 2012, Nikita Houston (backing vocals, percussion) and Sakai Smith (backing vocals, percussion) joined Train. Following Scott Underwood's departure in summer 2014, Drew Shoals is now the drummer for the band.\nIn April 2012, Train released their sixth studio album titled California 37. The first single from the album entitled \"Drive By\" reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was a Top 10 hit in the UK, their first Top 20 single since 2009. Train have sold over 10 million albums and 30 million tracks worldwide.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Travis are a Scottish alternative rock band from Glasgow, comprising Fran Healy (lead vocalist, rhythm guitar), Dougie Payne (bass guitar, backing vocals), Andy Dunlop (lead guitar, banjo, backing vocals) and Neil Primrose (drums, percussion). They named themselves after the Harry Dean Stanton character Travis Henderson from the film Paris, Texas.\n\nThe band's debut album Good Feeling, released on 8 September 1997 entered the UK Albums Chart at number 9, spending nine weeks inside the UK Top 100. Singles released from the album were not too successful, with the album's lead single \"All I Want to Do Is Rock\" charting at number 39 on the UK Singles Chart. However, it wasn't until the release of their second studio album The Man Who that Travis began to develop a name for themselves in the music industry, with continued success into the 2000s. The Man Who charted at number 1 on the UK Albums Chart, and spent 104 weeks inside the UK Top 100.\n\nTheir third studio album, The Invisible Band was released on 11 June 2001, and like The Man Who, The Invisible Band debuted at number 1 on the UK Albums Chart, where it remained for 4 weeks in total, and went onto spend a total of 54 weeks inside the UK Albums Chart. Although their fourth album, 12 Memories did not make the top spot in the United Kingdom, it debuted at number 3, spending a further 11 weeks on the charts in the UK, and still got certified Platinum status by the BPI. Travis released a compilation album Singles in 2004, debuting at number 4 on the UK Albums Chart, released their fifth studio album The Boy With No Name in 2007, debuting at number 4 on the UK Albums Chart. and their sixth album was released in September 2008, entitled Ode To J. Smith, debuting at number 20 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nThe band that would become Travis was formed by brothers Chris and Geoff Martyn. Andy Dunlop, a school friend at Lenzie Academy, was drafted in on guitar, followed soon after by Neil Primrose on drums. The line-up was completed by a female vocalist, Catherine Maxwell, and the band's name became \"Glass Onion\", after the Beatles song of the same name written by Lennon/McCartney). After parting company with their singer in the spring of 1991, they auditioned for a new vocalist. Having met each other through Primrose pouring him a pint, an untrained art student, Fran Healy, then joined after being invited to audition by Primrose. Healy joined the band on the day he enrolled at The Glasgow School of Art, in the autumn of 1991. Two years later, with the option of music holding more appeal, Healy dropped out of art school, and inspired by song writers such as Joni Mitchell, shortly after, assumed songwriting responsibilities. With brothers Chris and Geoff Martyn on bass and keyboards, in 1993, the fivesome released a privately made CD, The Glass Onion EP, featuring the tracks \"Dream On\", \"The Day Before\", \"Free Soul\" and \"Whenever She Comes Round\". 500 copies of the EP were made and were recently valued at Â£1000 each. Other songs they recorded but were left off are \"She's So Strange\" and \"Not About to Change\".\n\nThe band won a talent contest organised by the Music in Scotland Trust, who promised Â£2,000 so that Travis could deal-hunt at a new music seminar in New York. Two weeks before they were due to leave, however, the prize was instead given to the Music in Scotland Trust Directory. When sent a copy of the directory, the band noticed that it seemed to feature every single band in Scotland-except for them.\n\nThe band showed promise but had yet to evolve into a decent line-up capable of fulfilling it and spent several years treading water. According to their publisher Charlie Pinder: \"They were a band that everyone in the A&R community knew about and would go and see every now and then. But they weren’t very good. They had quite good songs; Fran always did write good songs.\" While on a visit to Scotland, American engineer and producer Niko Bolas, a long-time Neil Young and Rolling Stones associate, tuned into a Travis session on Radio Scotland, and heard something in the band's music which instantly made him travel to Perth to see them. Healy: \"He told us we were shit, took us in the studio for four days, and taught us how to play properly, like a band. He was bolsy, rude, and New York pushy. He didn't believe my lyrics and told me to write what I believed in and not tell lies. He was Mary Poppins, he sorted us out.\" The band recorded a five-song demo, which included the song \"All I Want to Do Is Rock\".",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Twenty One Pilots (stylized as twenty|one|pilots) is an American musical duo from Columbus, Ohio. The band was formed in 2009 and consists of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun.  They put out two self-released albums, Twenty One Pilots in 2009 and Regional at Best in 2011, before being signed by Fueled by Ramen in 2012. They released their first Fueled by Ramen full-length album, Vessel, in 2013.\n\nThe band was formed in 2009 in Columbus, Ohio by college friends, Tyler Joseph, Nick Thomas and Chris Salih. Tyler came up with the band's name while studying All My Sons by Arthur Miller, a play about a man who must decide what is best for his family after causing the death of 21 pilots during World War II because he knowingly sent them faulty parts for the good of his business. Tyler explains that this story of moral dilemma was the inspiration for the name of the band. On December 29, 2009, they released their debut, self-titled album, Twenty One Pilots, and began touring Ohio.\n\nIn 2010, the band released two officially unreleased tracks to their SoundCloud account. These included an original song titled \"Time to Say Goodbye\" and a cover of \"Jar of Hearts\" by Christina Perri. They were originally available for free download, though the option has since been removed.\n\nIn mid 2011, Thomas and Salih sequentially left due to busy schedules. Both posted farewell notes on the band's official Facebook page. Joseph was then joined by Josh Dun, former live drummer of House of Heroes.\n\nTwenty One Pilots bring a mix of piano (sometimes an electronic keyboard or a keytar), synthesizer, drums (also mixed with electronic drums some parts), vocals, and occasionally ukulele. Their songs are poetry-based (written by Joseph and Dun). Joseph has stated that when poetry is too long, he needs to start rapping to fit the lyrics in.\n\nPeople typically have trouble affiliating the band to a specific genre to describe them, since they bridge so many. However, many fans (and themselves to a degree) have labeled them \"Schizophrenic pop\" (also known as Schizoid pop), a technically unofficial subgenre of pop.\n\nAlthough many of their songs contain allusions to Christian theology and have messages (even if implied) about God, and all members of the band (past and present) are Christians, Twenty One Pilots is not considered a Christian band.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Carl Mitchell grew up in the K-Town area of the North Lawndale neighborhood of western Chicago, Illinois and began rapping when he was 12. In 1991, Mitchell released his first album called Runnin' Off at da Mouth under the name Tung Twista.\n\nHis second album, titled Resurrection, was set to be released in 1994, but due to problems with record labels and marketing issues involving fellow Chicago rapper Common's album of the same name, the album was only released in the city of Chicago and thus got little national attention.\n\nIn 1996 he teamed with Chicago producer The Legendary Traxster and Cwal's Do or Die on the track \"Po Pimp\" produced by The Legendary Traxster, which became a hit single. This led to a Cwal's label deal with Atlantic Records, which released Adrenaline Rush in 1997. Twista had by then dropped the \"Tung\" from his stage name. Adrenaline Rush became Twista's first charting album, as it peaked at #77 on the Billboard Hot 200. The album also spawned a Billboard Hot 100 hit in \"Get It Wet\" produced by The Legendary Traxster, which peaked at #96.\n\nIn 1998 Twista teamed with other Chicago area rappers to form the Speedknot Mobstaz. They released their first album, Mobstability produced entirely by The Legendary Traxster, in 1998. Twista then formed his own Legit Ballin' label, which released two compilation albums: Legit Ballin' in 1999 and Legit Ballin' Vol. 2: Street Scriptures in 2001. The label later released Respect The Game, Vol. 3 in 2002 and Volume 4: Tha Truth in 2006. In 2000, Twista collaborated with Ruff Ryders and Drag-On on the Ruff Ryders: Ryde or Die Vol. 2 album, on the track \"Twisted Heat.\"\n\nBeginning in 2002, Twista began recording his album Kamikaze with rappers like Kanye West and Ludacris. Kamikaze came out in 2004 and debuted at the top spot of the American Billboard 200 album chart. Its first single \"Slow Jamz\" (also featured on Kanye West's debut album The College Dropout), featured West and Jamie Foxx and became a number-one hit in the US. Other singles included \"Overnight Celebrity\" and \"So Sexy\" (featuring R. Kelly); the album sold around two million copies. The remix of the song \"Jook Gal\" by Elephant Man featured Twista and the YoungBloodZ. The Kamikaze album and its singles gave Twista a new level of success and rose his profile significantly within the rap community.\n\nTwista's album The Day After was released in 2005. It featured the hit singles \"Girl Tonite\" featuring Trey Songz, \"Hit the Floor\" featuring Pitbull, and \"So Lonely\" featuring Mariah Carey. His next album, Adrenaline Rush 2007 came out in 2007. Its singles were \"Give it Up\" featuring Pharrell and \"Creep Fast\" featuring T-Pain. This album sold poorly compared to Twista's earlier albums. Twista appeared on the single \"Hell No (Leave Home)\" from Monica's album fall 2006 The Makings of Me.\n\nIn 2008, Twista launched a new record label called Get Money Gang Entertainment and the album Category F5 with the hit, \"Wetter\". In 2009, Twista appeared on the single \"Legendary\" with fellow Chicago rappers AK47 of Do or Die and Saurus and Bones.\n\nTwista released his eighth solo album entitled, The Perfect Storm on Nov 9, 2010. The first single from the album, \"Make a Movie\" produced by The Legendary Traxster, featuring Chris Brown, was released on August 24, 2010. Two buzz singles were released, \"I Do\" produced by Traxster and \"Heat\" produced by fellow Chicago producers NO I.D. and The Legendary Traxster. The album features artists such as Waka Flocka Flame, Raekwon, Tia London, Diddy, Ray J, Chief Keef and others. Production on the album is mainly by The Legendary Traxster along with Streetrunner, Twinz, Tight Mike and NO I.D.\n\nIn an October 31, 2010 interview on Conspiracy Worldwide Radio, Twista discussed his new documentary, directed by Vlad Yudin and the making of The Perfect Storm, including his belief that artists need to do more than just record songs and that they need to become more involved with the community around them.\n\nDuring the holiday season in 2010, Twista and his GMG team worked together with Chicago Food Bank's Producemobile program to feed hungry people in the community.\n\nIn 2013 Twista is working on his 9th studio album entitled The Dark Horse. He also currently struck a deal with Kanye West music label GOOD Music. All of his albums will now be distributed by Def Jam marking his return to a major label since leaving Atlantic Records in 2007. His own label Get Money Gang Entertainment will be distributed by Capital Records.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Twisted Sister is an American heavy metal band from Long Island, New York. Musically, the band implements elements of traditional heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest along with a driving hard rock style that is similar to AC/DC. While the band members' famously cross-dressed appearance might seem to link them with the 1980s glam metal movement, Twisted Sister's aggressive musical style was coupled with a more grotesque use of makeup and women's clothing resulting in a product quite distinct from the more hedonistic androgyny of glam metal groups like Mötley Crue and Poison. The band considers the \"glam metal\" tag to be inappropriate.\n\nTwisted Sister are also ranked No.73 in VH1's 100 greatest artists of hard rock.\n\nAlthough the band was formed by guitarist Jay Jay French in December 1972, all of their songs were written by Dee Snider from 1976 onward. Snider remarked to David Letterman that the proposed name for the band was \"This\" but was rejected for fear of fans saying \"This sucks\". He describes Twisted Sister as \"Slade meets Sex Pistols\". Twisted Sister's most well-known hits include \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" and \"I Wanna Rock\", both popularized in the USA by regular airplay on MTV in the 1980s. Many of the band's songs explore themes of parent vs. child conflicts and criticisms of the educational system.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Two Door Cinema Club are an indie rock band from Bangor and Donaghadee, County Down, Northern Ireland. Formed in 2007, the band is composed of band members: Sam Halliday (lead guitar, backing vocals), Alex Trimble (vocals, rhythm guitar, beats, synths) and Kevin Baird (bass, backing vocals). They are signed to French record label Kitsuné Music, through whom they released their debut album, Tourist History on 1 March 2010. It won the Choice Music Prize for Irish Album of the Year 2010 the following year.\nTrimble and Halliday first met while attending Bangor Grammar School, and met Baird when he was trying to \"get with\" girls they knew. The band's name came about after Halliday mispronounced the name of the local cinema, Tudor Cinema. In 2007, Two Door Cinema Club was formed, and following an increased interest in their music on their MySpace page, they gave up their university places and began work on studio material. An EP entitled Four Words to Stand On was released in January 2009 and was positively received by critics. A number of music blogs featured articles about the band and their popularity increased. In July 2009, Two Door Cinema Club began recording their debut album at Eastcote Studios in London with Eliot James. In September, the band began mixing the record with Phillipe Zdar at Motorbass, his studio in Paris.\nIn December 2009, Two Door Cinema Club were featured in the BBC's Sound Of 2010 Poll, which was decided by 165 British \"tastemakers\".\nIn January 2010, Two Door Cinema Club announced the track listing and details of their debut album in an interview with NME. It was released on 26 February 2010 in the Republic of Ireland and on 1 March 2010 in the UK. The album, entitled Tourist History, was released in the USA on 27 April 2010. The album was also preceded by the singles \"Something Good Can Work\", \"I Can Talk\" and \"Undercover Martyn\" of which \"Something Good Can Work\" and \"Undercover Martyn\" featured on television advertisements for Vodafone and Meteor. \"Undercover Martyn\" also featured on the soundtrack of Gran Turismo 5 while \"I Can Talk\" is featured on the soundtrack of FIFA 11 & NBA 2K11.

        "strBiographyEN" : "U2 are an Irish rock band from Dublin. Formed in 1976, the group consists of Bono (vocals and rhythm guitar), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen, Jr. (drums and percussion). U2's early sound was rooted in post-punk but eventually grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music. Throughout the group's musical pursuits, they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns.\nThe band formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in 1976 when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album Boy. By the mid-1980s, U2 had become a top international act. They were more successful as a touring act than they were at selling records until their 1987 album The Joshua Tree which, according to Rolling Stone, elevated the band's stature \"from heroes to superstars\". Reacting to musical stagnation and criticism of their earnest image and musical direction in the late 1980s, U2 reinvented themselves with their 1991 album, Achtung Baby, and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour; they integrated dance, industrial, and alternative rock influences into their sound, and embraced a more ironic and self-deprecating image. They embraced similar experimentation for the remainder of the 1990s with varying levels of success. U2 regained critical and commercial favour in the 2000s with the records All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group. Their U2 360° Tour of 2009–2011 is the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour in history.\nU2 have released 13 studio albums and are one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 170 million records worldwide. They have won 22 Grammy Awards, more than any other band; and, in 2005, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. Rolling Stone ranked U2 at number 22 in its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and labelled them the \"Biggest Band in the World\". Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes, including Amnesty International, the ONE/DATA campaigns, Product Red, War Child and the Edge's Music Rising.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Singer Phil Mogg, guitarist Mick Bolton, bassist Pete Way, and drummer Andy Parker formed the band in August 1969. Originally taking the name Hocus Pocus, the group changed their name in October 1969 to UFO in honour of the London club where they were spotted by Noel Moore, who signed them to Beacon Records label, which was headed by Antiguan-born Milton Samuel. Their eponymously titled first album debuted in 1970 and was a typical example of early hard rock including a heavy version of the Eddie Cochran's classic \"C'mon Everybody\". Both UFO 1 and its follow-up UFO 2: Flying, were successful in Japan (especially the single \"C'mon Everybody\" which became a huge hit there) and Germany (the song \"Boogie For George,\" also from the first album, reached No. 30 in German singles charts as well as \"Prince Kajuku\" from Flying reached No. 26), but generated poor interest in Britain and America. Consequently, their third effort, Live (later re-issued as UFO Lands In Tokyo), was originally only released in Japan in 1971.\nPart of UFO's early work was strongly influenced by space rock (their second album, including a 26-minute long title track and a 19-minute long opus \"Star Storm\", was subtitled One Hour Space Rock) that was modestly popular at the time, but the band soon realised the style was somewhat limited. In January 1972, Mick Bolton left the group, and UFO set out to find a guitarist who could provide the band with a more standard rock sound. Bolton later appeared with Mott the Hoople, Paul Brady, and on Linda McCartney's Wide Prairie.\nInternational success (1973–1978)\nAfter brief trial runs with Larry Wallis (February - October 1972) and Bernie Marsden (he toured with UFO in Europe and recorded a demo, \"Give Her The Gun\") the band recruited Michael Schenker from Scorpions in June 1973. Schenker was only 18 at the time but was already a well-respected guitarist. On a new label, Chrysalis Records, and with a new producer, Leo Lyons (formerly of Ten Years After), UFO recorded Phenomenon in 1974, which debuted the band's harder-edged guitar sound. Phenomenon contains many fan favorites such as \"Doctor Doctor\" (later a minor hit single as a live track) and \"Rock Bottom\" (which was extended live to provide a showcase for Schenker). By the time of the Phenomenon tour, ex-Skid Row guitarist Paul Chapman joined the group, but he left in January 1975 to form Lone Star.\nTwo later albums, Force It (July 1975) and No Heavy Petting (May 1976) (the last was recorded with a regular keyboardist, Danny Peyronel as well as harmony vocalist and also songwriter), and extensive touring brought UFO increased visibility with American audiences and increased their following in the UK.\nIn July, 1976 the band recruited keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Paul Raymond from Savoy Brown to make 1977's Lights Out. This album was the pinnacle of UFO's studio career containing songs such as \"Too Hot To Handle,\" \"Lights Out,\" and the 7-minute opus \"Love To Love.\" With Lights Out, the band received substantial critical acclaim. With their new-found success, the band went back into the studio to record Obsession in 1978. Later that year, the band went on tour in the USA and recorded a live album, Strangers In The Night, which was released in January 1979. Strangers was a critical and commercial success actually reaching Number 1 in the UK album charts in February 1979.\nSchenker's departure (1978)\nAlong with Michael Schenker's increasing alcohol abuse, tensions had begun to grow between Mogg and Schenker in the late 1970s. Soon after UFO's final US show in Palo Alto, California in October 1978 Schenker left the band. He made a brief return to the Scorpions before going on to form his own Michael Schenker Group.\nPost-Schenker years (1979–1990)\nAfter Schenker's exit, UFO rehired Paul \"Tonka\" Chapman on guitar who brought over unused track ideas from Lone Star's drummer Dixie Lee. Shortly after they released their next LP, No Place To Run in January, 1980. Produced by the former Beatles producer, George Martin No Place To Run failed to match up to the success of its predecessors, though it fractionally missed the UK Top 10. Paul Raymond left the band at the end of the No Place To Run tour and was replaced by John Sloman from Uriah Heep for a couple of months and then by former Wild Horses guitarist and keyboardist Neil Carter, who helped fill the void in the songwriting left by Schenker's departure. Carter debuted with UFO on stage at the three-day Reading Festival on August 23, 1980, when the band played as the Saturday night headline act. At the beginning of the following year, UFO released the self-produced The Wild, the Willing and the Innocent, which had a lighter pop rock sound, which was popular at the time. The album achieved mild success in the UK, reaching the UK Top 20, and the single \"Lonely Heart\" was released.\nIn February 1982 the band released Mechanix. It contained the popular song, \"Back Into My Life\", which was a minor hit in the USA. However, the album was very successful in the UK, where it reached No.8, the band's highest ever placing. Later that year, founding member Pete Way left the band to form Fastway with Motörhead guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke and then his own band, Waysted. He was replaced by Talas bassist, Billy Sheehan. UFO released Making Contact in 1983, but the album was a critical and commercial failure. Thus, that March, UFO decided to disband. The band played a UK farewell tour with Paul Gray (ex Eddie and the Hot Rods and The Damned bassist). However, there was a hint that this might not be permanent, when UFO released a compilation album featuring songs by UFO (as well as other groups featuring ex-members of UFO) entitled Headstone, the sleeve of which showed a headstone, denoting UFO with their formation date but an incomplete end date.\nThis proved to be a short hiatus as, two years later, Mogg assembled a new UFO line-up, featuring Paul Gray on bass again and Atomic Tommy M on guitar and released Misdemeanor. This was followed by the 1988 EP Ain't Misbehavin'. Despite the renewed activity of the band, neither release was financially successful and they officially disbanded again in 1989.\nThe reunion(s) (1991–2003)\nIn 1992, Mogg and Way decided to put a new UFO line-up together with Clive Edwards and Laurence Archer in the band and released High Stakes & Dangerous Men. While only released on a small independent label, High Stakes was enough to generate serious interest in a full-blown reunion. The following year, the classic late-1970s UFO line-up – Mogg, Schenker, Way, Raymond and Parker – reunited, and the resulting album was Walk on Water (1995). This line-up (barring Parker's replacement by AC/DC's Simon Wright on drums) went on a world tour. However, tensions arose again, and Schenker left the band in the middle of the tour. Thereafter, the other members again went their separate ways. However, Schenker returned to the fold in 1998 and the band embarked on another tour, with Parker again replaced by a new drummer. They played at the Astoria, Charing Cross Road, London in 1998.\nPhil Mogg and Pete Way continued working together throughout this fluctuating band membership, releasing two albums under the Mogg/Way name in the late 1990s, – Edge of the World and Chocolate Box.\nIn 2000, Schenker rejoined UFO again and the band released the double CD Covenant (with Aynsley Dunbar on drums), which contained a disc of new material and a disc of live classics. In 2002, the band recorded Sharks; shortly after Sharks was released, Schenker left the band yet again and was replaced with Vinnie Moore. In 2003, Michael Schenker and Pete Way released The Plot with drummer Jeff Martin.\nVinnie Moore and a return to chart success (2004–present)\nIn 2004 UFO released their seventeenth studio album You Are Here with their new permanent guitarist Vinnie Moore and Jason Bonham on drums (intermittently). UFO recorded their live set and released a double-DVD recording titled Showtime (2005) along with a double live CD on SPV in November 2005, mixing a number of re-recorded studio songs. In November 2005, Andy Parker returned to the band to play in the Piorno Rock Festival in Granada, Spain. UFO's eighteenth studio album, titled The Monkey Puzzle, was released in 2006.\nAndy Parker returned in early 2007 after recovering from leg surgery. On the 2008 tour, Pete Way was unable to get a work visa to enter the United States, Rob De Luca (of Sebastian Bach's band) filling in.\nUFO released their nineteenth studio album, The Visitor, in June 2009, and followed with a tour of the UK, but without Pete Way, who was suffering from a medical condition. Bass tracks on The Visitor were also played by Peter Pichl, and Pete Way was not credited as a band member on The Visitor cover, nor was any other bassist. However, the album saw UFO's return to the UK Top 100 album charts for the first time in almost 15 years.\nIn July 2009 UFO released a six CD live concert box set, containing six concerts between 1975 to 1982 as well as previously unreleased live songs.\nOn their 2011 tour, they were accompanied by Barry Sparks playing bass.\nSince December 2010, UFO had been working on a twentieth studio album, which was supposed to be released in June 2011. Titled Seven Deadly, was released on February 27, 2012 to almost universally good reviews and a higher chart position than The Visitor also charting in Germany, Sweden, and the Billboard indie charts.\nIn 2011, former band members Danny Peyronel, Laurence Archer, and Clive Edwards teamed up with bassist Rocky Newton (ex-McAuley Schenker Group) to form a band entitled X-UFO. In live performances, X-UFO played sets of vintage UFO songs.",

Usher rose to fame in the late 1990s with the release of his second album My Way, which spawned his first Billboard Hot 100 number-one hit, \"Nice & Slow\". The album has been certified 6-times platinum by the RIAA. His follow-up album, 8701, produced the Billboard Hot 100 number one hits \"U Remind Me\" and \"U Got It Bad\". The album has been certified 4-times platinum by the RIAA.\n\nUsher's 2004 album Confessions sold over 10 million copies in the United States, and been certified diamond by the RIAA. Confessions has the highest first week sales for an R&B artist in history. It spawned four consecutive Billboard number-one hits-\"Yeah!\", \"Burn\", \"Confessions Part II\", and \"My Boo\". Usher's 2008 album Here I Stand sold over 5 million copies worldwide, and its lead single \"Love In This Club\" peaked at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nOn March 30, 2010, Usher released his sixth studio album Raymond v. Raymond, which became his third consecutive album to debut at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart. It has been certified platinum by the RIAA, and spawned another Billboard Hot 100 number-one hit \"OMG\". The song became his ninth number one in the United States, making him the first 2010s artist to collect number one singles in three consecutive decades. He later released an extended play and deluxe edition of \"Raymond v. Raymond\", entitled Versus, which debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart. Its lead single \"DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love\" reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe RIAA ranks Usher as one of the best-selling artists in American music history, having sold over 23 million copies in the United States alone. To date, he has sold over 65 million records worldwide, making him one of the Best selling music artists of all time. Usher, has won numerous awards including seven Grammy Awards. At the end of 2009, Usher was named the number one Hot 100 artist of the 2000s decade. Billboard named him the second most successful artist of the 2000s decade, with his 2004 album Confessions being ranked as the top solo album of the 2000s decade. Billboard also placed Usher at number six on their list of Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years. Usher has attained nine Hot 100 number-one hits (all as a lead artist) and has attained seventeen Hot 100 top-ten hits.\n\nUsher was born in Dallas, Texas, the son of Jonetta Patton (née O'Neal) and Usher Raymond III. Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga: his father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey, born in 1984. Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old; there, his grandmother discovered his ability to sing, although it was not until Usher joined a singing group that she considered he could sing professionally. In the belief that a bigger city would provide greater opportunities for showcasing his talent, Usher's family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where there was a more conducive environment for beginning singers. While in Atlanta, Usher attended North Springs High School. Usher's father died of a heart attack on January 21, 2008.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Van Halen is an American hard rock band formed in Pasadena, California, in 1972. The band achieved success after the release of its debut album Van Halen (1978). As of 2007, Van Halen has sold 75 million albums worldwide and has had the most #1 hits on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Van Halen is the 19th best-selling band/artist of all time with sales of over 56 million albums in the United States alone, and is one of five rock bands that have had two albums sell more than 10 million copies in the U.S. In 1996, the RIAA certified their debut album diamond for ten million in U.S. sales.\n\nThe band is also known for the drama surrounding the exits of former members. The multiple exits of lead singers David Lee Roth, Sammy Hagar and Gary Cherone were surrounded in controversy and press coverage, including numerous conflicting press statements between the former singers and the band. Following their 2004 concert tour the band was on a hiatus from the public until September 2006, when new bassist Wolfgang Van Halen's place was confirmed and Roth reunion rumors began to re-surface, both events coinciding with the band's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction on March 12, 2007. After years of speculation, Van Halen began a tour with Roth across North America in 2007 and into 2008. On December 26, 2011, Van Halen announced a tour for 2012, and released their first album in 14 years, A Different Kind of Truth, on February 7, 2012.\n\nBorn in Nijmegen, Netherlands, Eddie Van Halen and Alex Van Halen are the sons of musician Jan Van Halen, who arranged for them to have music lessons. The Van Halen brothers started playing music together in the 1960s when Eddie played classical piano and later drums, and Alex played the guitar. While Eddie was delivering newspapers on his paper route, Alex would sneak over and play on Eddie's drumset. Eventually Eddie found out about Alex playing his drum set and was so frustrated that he told Alex, \"OK, I'll go play your guitar.\"\n\nIn 1972 the Van Halen brothers formed a band called \"Genesis\" featuring Eddie as lead vocalist/guitarist, Alex on drums, and Mark Stone on bass. They initially rented a sound system from David Lee Roth but decided to save money by letting him join as lead vocalist even though his previous audition(s) had been unsuccessful. By 1974 the band decided to replace Stone, so Michael Anthony, bassist and lead vocalist from local band \"Snake\" was auditioned. Following an all-night jam session, he was hired for bass and backing vocals.\n\nThe band later changed its name to Mammoth when they discovered the name \"Genesis\" already was being used. So in 1974 \"Mammoth\" officially changed its name to \"Van Halen\". According to Roth, this was his brainchild. He felt it was a name that had power, like Santana. They played backyard parties and on a flatbed truck at Hamilton Park. Van Halen played clubs in Pasadena and Hollywood to growing audiences, increasing their popularity through self promotion: before each gig they would pass out fliers at local high schools. This soon built them a major following. Later that year, the band got its first break when it was hired to play at Gazzarri's, a formerly famous but down-at-the-heels night club on the Sunset Strip which closed in 1996.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Van Morrison, OBE (born George Ivan Morrison; 31 August 1945) is a Northern Irish singer-songwriter and musician. His live performances at their best are regarded as transcendental and inspired; while some of his recordings, such as the studio albums Astral Weeks and Moondance, and the live album It's Too Late to Stop Now, are widely viewed as among the greatest ever made.\nKnown as \"Van the Man\" to his fans, Morrison started his professional career when, as a teenager in the late 1950s, he played a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for various Irish showbands covering the popular hits of the day. He rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R&B band Them, with whom he recorded the garage band classic \"Gloria\". His solo career began under the pop-hit oriented guidance of Bert Berns with the release of the hit single \"Brown Eyed Girl\" in 1967. After Berns' death, Warner Bros. Records bought out his contract and allowed him three sessions to record Astral Weeks in 1968. Even though this album would gradually garner high praise, it was initially poorly received; however, the next one, Moondance, established Morrison as a major artist, and throughout the 1970s he built on his reputation with a series of critically acclaimed albums and live performances. Morrison continues to record and tour, producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received, sometimes collaborating with other artists, such as Georgie Fame and The Chieftains. In 2008 he performed Astral Weeks live for the first time since 1968.\nMuch of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and R&B, such as the popular singles \"Brown Eyed Girl\", \"Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)\", \"Domino\" and \"Wild Night\". An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz, and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as Astral Weeks and lesser-known works such as Veedon Fleece and Common One. The two strains together are sometimes referred to as \"Celtic Soul\".\nMorrison has received considerable acclaim, including six Grammy Awards, being inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and appearing on several \"Greatest Artists\" lists.",

The first single, \"The Right Stuff\", found success on the R&B chart, while the second single, \"He's Got the Look\", found similar success on the same chart. The third single, \"Dreamin'\", was a pop hit, becoming Williams' first top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 8, and her first number one single on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The album reached gold status in the U.S. and earned her three Grammy Award nominations, including one for Best New Artist.\n\nHer second album The Comfort Zone became the biggest success in her music career. The lead single \"Running Back to You\" reached top twenty on the Hot 100, and the top position of Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart on October 5, 1991. Other singles included \"The Comfort Zone\" (#2 R&B), \"Just for Tonight\" (#26 Pop), a cover of The Isley Brothers' \"Work to Do\" (#3 R&B), and the club-only hit \"Freedom Dance (Get Free!).\" The most successful single from the album, as well as her biggest hit to date, is \"Save the Best for Last\". It reached No. 1 in the United States, where it remained for five weeks, as well as No. 1 in Australia, the Netherlands, and Canada, and was in the top 5 in Japan, Ireland and the United Kingdom. The album sold 2.2 million copies in the U.S. at its time of release and has since been certified triple platinum in the United States by the RIAA, gold in Canada by the CRIA, and platinum in the United Kingdom by the BPI. The Comfort Zone earned Williams five Grammy Award nominations. The Sweetest Days, her third album, was released in 1994 to highly-favorable reviews. The album saw Williams branch out and sample other styles of music that included jazz, hip hop, rock, and Latin-themed recordings such as \"Betcha Never\" and \"You Can't Run\", both written and produced by Babyface. Other singles from the album included the adult-contemporary and dance hit \"The Way That You Love\" and the title track \"The Sweetest Days\". The album was certified platinum in the U.S. by the RIAA and earned her two Grammy Award nominations.\n\nOther releases include two Christmas albums, Star Bright, released in 1996, and Silver & Gold in 2004; Next in 1997, and Everlasting Love in 2005, along with a greatest-hits compilation released in 1998, and a host of other compilations released over the years. Notable chart performances from subsequent albums, motion picture and television soundtracks have included the songs \"Love Is\", which was a duet with Brian McKnight, the Golden Globe- and Academy Award-winning \"Colors of the Wind\", \"Where Do We Go from Here?\", and \"Oh How the Years Go By\". In total, Williams has sold more than six million records and has received 15 Grammy Award nominations. In May 2009 she performed two concerts at the Tropicana Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City to sold out crowds. On June 2, 2009, she released her eighth studio album on Concord Records titled The Real Thing. It features songs written and/or produced by Babyface, Stevie Wonder, Bill Withers, Bebel Gilberto, and Rex Rideout. Williams described the album as \"a hybrid of samba, bossa nova, some salsa and also some pop and R&B\". The title song \"The Real Thing\", the fourth single released from the album, peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Since coming together in Los Angeles in 1992, the members of Weezer have lived an especially capricious existence: In the course of a decade, they went from dorky alt-rock heroes to absentee cult figures to arena-filling megastars. The band's original lineup — lead singer and songwriter Rivers Cuomo, bassist Matt Sharp, drummer Patrick Wilson and guitarist Brian Bell — looked uncomfortable from the get-go, posing for the cover of their 1994 self-titled debut as though they were waiting to be noogied. Few might have predicted that, a decade and a half on, the band would prove consummate rock & roll pros.\nProduced by ex-Cars frontman Ric Ocasek, Weezer (Number 16, 1994), more commonly known as the Blue Album, largely eschewed grunge's angst-y, soul-baring angst howl. Cuomo didn't profess the cynicism of Kurt Cobain, and the unapologetic riffs made it clear that he was more influenced by the likes of Heaven Tonight than Raw Power. Songs like \"Undone - The Sweater Song\" (Number 57, 1994) sounded like handwritten notes found at the bottom of a locker — the early musings of a colossally self-aware nerd. The album's best-known early song, \"Buddy Holly\" (Number Two Modern Rock, 1994) mated Spike Jonze's nostalgia-tripping, \"Happy Days\"-based video with an equally nostalgic and chimerical young-and-in-love chorus: \"Wooh-e-oooh, I like just like Buddy Holly/Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore.\" Weezer would sell more than 3 million copies, and a 2004 reissued edition includes several worthy B-sides.\nCuomo had originally intended for Weezer's follow-up to be a sci-fi rock opera called Songs from the Black Hole, but after recording a series of tracks by himself, he shelved the project in favor of Pinkerton (Number 19, 1996). Though it's since become a fan favorite and a bellwether for he late-Nineties emo boom, Pinkerton was initially seen as a downer: Cuomo had undergone a painful leg operation after the Blue Album, and the new LP was packed with brutally honest songs about falling in love with lesbians and teenage fans living oceans away; the opening track, tellingly, was \"Tired of Sex,\" and songs like \"El Scorcho\" (Number 19 Modern Rock, 1996), and \"The Good Life\" (Number 32 Modern Rock, 1996) were rife with frustration. The album takes its name from a character in Madame Butterfly, and the record is peppered with references to the opera.\nAfter a tour in support of the album — which failed to reach platinum — Sharp left the band to spend more time with his new-wave-reviving side project, the Rentals, while Cuomo dropped out of view altogether, prompting rumors that he had begun a Brian Wilson-like retreat from society (Cuomo left Harvard but returned again, earning his English degree in June 2006). Between 1997 and 2000, the band released only a handful of songs, including a cover of \"Velouria\" for a Pixies tribute album. But the band retained an ardent following on the Internet, as evidenced by the numerous threads about Pinkerton, which was quickly becoming a cult favorite.\nIn 2000, the band reformed for a string of shows on the Warped Tour, where Sharp was replaced by bassist Mikey Welsh, a former member of Juliana Hatfield's backing band. The live dates were a success, prompting a sold-out mini-tour and a new album, titled Weezer (2001), which debuted at Number Four on the Billboard charts and retuned the band to its power-chord grandeur. With Ocasek returning as producer, the so-called \"Green album\" gave the band two of the biggest hits of its career: \"Hash Pipe\" (Number Two Modern Rock), and \"Island in the Sun\" (Number 11 Modern Rock), a lulling ballad that later wound up being covered for a tropical-resort ad. A few months after the Green Album's release, Welsh experienced a psychotic breakdown, and was replaced by bassist Scott Shriner.\nAlmost exactly a year after the release of the Green Album, Weezer delivered Maladroit (Number Three, 2002). Due in part to Cuomo's abundant songwriting output, many of the self-financed Maladroit tracks had already appeared in demo form on the band's Website, and the songs' early release spurred a public battle between the band and its label, Interscope Records. But neither the controversy — nor the inclusion of singles \"Dope Nose\" (Number Eight Modern Rock) and \"Keep Fishin'\" (Number 15 Modern Rock) — could prevent Maladroit, an album that paid homage to several of Cuomo's metal influences, from failing commercially.\nWeezer teamed with Rick Rubin for 2005's Make Believe (Number Two), an album that gave the band its biggest single to date: \"Beverly Hills\" (Number 10, 2005) a sarcastic anti-fame rant that was misinterpreted by some as an ode to luxury branding. Longtime fans lamented that the Weezer responsible for Pinkerton was long gone, but \"Beverly Hills\" and the piano-plunking anthem \"Perfect Situation\" (Number 51, 2006) helped Make Believe sell more than a million copies in the U.S., and prompted an arena tour with the Foo Fighters.\nIn 2007, Cuomo released Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo (Number 163), a collection of demos that included songs originally intended for the long-jettisoned Songs from the Black Hole. Weezer's sixth album, once again produced by Rick Rubin — and once again titled Weezer — was released June 3rd, 2008 and hit Number Four in Billboard. The Red Album, as it's known, spawned the single \"Pork and Beans\" (Number 64, 2008), boosted by a clever video featuring numerous fly-by-night YouTube stars.\nThe band toured with Blink-182 in 2009, and the album Raditude (Number Seven) — featuring collaborations with r&b/hip-hop producer Jermaine Dupri, teen-pop songwriter Dr. Luke, and rapper Lil Wayne — followed. But the single, \"(If You're Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To\", peaked at only Number 81 on the Billboard Hot 100. At the end of 2009, reports surfaced that the band had split with Geffen Records.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Whitney Elizabeth Houston (August 9, 1963 - February 11, 2012) was an American recording artist, actress, producer, and model. In 2009, the Guinness World Records cited her as the most-awarded female act of all-time. Houston was one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 170 million albums, singles and videos worldwide. She released six studio albums, one holiday album and three movie soundtrack albums, all of which have diamond, multi-platinum, platinum or gold certification. Houston's crossover appeal on the popular music charts, as well as her prominence on MTV, starting with her video for \"How Will I Know\", influenced several African American female artists to follow in her footsteps.\nHouston is the only artist to chart seven consecutive No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hits. She is the second artist behind Elton John and the only female artist to have two number-one Billboard 200 Album awards (formerly \"Top Pop Album\") on the Billboard magazine year-end charts. Houston's 1985 debut album Whitney Houston became the best-selling debut album by a female act at the time of its release. The album was named Rolling Stone's best album of 1986, and was ranked at number 254 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Her second studio album Whitney (1987) became the first album by a female artist to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart.\nHouston's first acting role was as the star of the feature film The Bodyguard (1992). The film's original soundtrack won the 1994 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Its lead single \"I Will Always Love You\", became the best-selling single by a female artist in music history. With the album, Houston became the first act (solo or group, male or female) to sell more than a million copies of an album within a single week period under Nielsen SoundScan system. The album makes her the top female act in the top 10 list of the best-selling albums of all time, at number four. Houston continued to star in movies and contribute to their soundtracks, including the films Waiting to Exhale (1995) and The Preacher's Wife (1996). The Preacher's Wife soundtrack became the best-selling gospel album in history.\nWhitney Houston was born in what was then a middle-income neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey, the second child of Army serviceman and entertainment executive John Russell Houston, Jr. (September 13, 1920 - February 2, 2003), and gospel singer Cissy Houston (née Emily Drinkard). She was of African American, Native American and Dutch descent. Her mother, along with cousins Dionne Warwick and Dee Dee Warwick, godmother Darlene Love and honorary aunt Aretha Franklin were all notable figures in the gospel, rhythm and blues, pop, and soul genres. She met her honorary aunt at age 8, or 9, when her mother took her to a recording studio. Houston was raised a Baptist, but was also exposed to the Pentecostal church. After the 1967 Newark riots, the family moved to a middle-class area in East Orange, New Jersey, when she was four.\nAt the age of 11, Houston started performing as a soloist in the junior gospel choir at the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, where she also learned to play the piano. Her first solo performance in the church was \"Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah\". When Houston was a teenager, she attended Mount Saint Dominic Academy, a Catholic girls' high school in Caldwell, New Jersey, where she met her best friend Robyn Crawford, whom she described as the \"sister she never had\". While Houston was still in school, her mother continued to teach her how to sing. Houston was also exposed to the music of Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, and Roberta Flack, most of whom would have an influence on her as a singer and performer.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Willie Hugh Nelson (Born April 30, 1933) is an American country music singer-songwriter, as well as an author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album Shotgun Willie (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of Red Headed Stranger (1975) and Stardust (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed at the end of the 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of Biofuel and the legalization of marijuana.\nBorn during the Great Depression, and raised by his grandparents, Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the Air Force but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended Baylor University for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. During this time, he worked as a disc jockey in Texas radio stations and a singer in honky tonks. Nelson moved to Vancouver, Washington, where he wrote \"Family Bible\" and recorded the song \"Lumberjack\" in 1956. In 1960, he signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join Ray Price's band as a bassist. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including \"Funny How Time Slips Away\", \"Hello Walls\", \"Pretty Paper\", and \"Crazy\". In 1962, he recorded his first album, And Then I Wrote. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with RCA Victor and joined the Grand Ole Opry the following year. After mid-chart hits during the end of 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s, and the failure to succeed in music, Nelson retired in 1972 and moved to Austin, Texas. The rise of the popularity of Hippie music in Austin motivated Nelson to return from retirement, performing frequently at the Armadillo World Headquarters.\n\nIn 1973, after signing with Atlantic Records, Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as Shotgun Willie and Phases and Stages. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album, Red Headed Stranger. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, Wanted! The Outlaws, along with Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, and Tompall Glaser. During the mid 1980s, while creating hit albums like Honeysuckle Rose and recording hit songs like \"On the Road Again\", \"To All the Girls I've Loved Before\", and \"Pancho & Lefty\", he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen, along with fellow singers, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson. During 1990 Nelson's assets were seized by the Internal Revenue Service, that claimed that he owed US $32,000,000. It was later discovered that his accountants, Price Waterhouse did not pay Nelson's taxes for years. The impossibility of Nelson to pay his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments made by him during the 1980s. Nelson released in 1991 The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?, the profits of the double album, destined to the IRS and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt by 1993. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively, and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. Nelson explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk. Nelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film, The Electric Horseman, followed by other appearances in movies and on television.\n\nNelson is a major liberal activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the bio-diesel brand Willie Nelson Biodiesel, which is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the Advisory Board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Yes are an English rock band who achieved success with their progressive, art and symphonic style of music. They are distinguished by their use of mystical and cosmic lyrics, live stage sets and lengthy compositions, often with complex instrumental and vocal arrangements. Seventeen musicians have been members of the band in its history; the current line-up since February 2012 consists of singer Jon Davison, guitarist Steve Howe, bass guitarist Chris Squire, keyboardist Geoff Downes, and drummer Alan White.\nSquire formed Yes in 1968 with singer Jon Anderson. Squire and guitarist Peter Banks had played together in The Syn and then Mabel Greer's Toyshop. Anderson and later drummer Bill Bruford joined a later line-up of Mabel Greer's Toyshop, which evolved into Yes. Keyboardist Tony Kaye completed the first Yes line-up. Their first two albums received lukewarm sales and reception. Early sets were a mix of original material and cover versions by other artists. In the 1970s, Yes reached their creative peak in the progressive genre when most notably Anderson, Squire, Howe, Bruford, White, and keyboardist Rick Wakeman were part of the band's line-ups, and produced what many critics consider their finest works: The Yes Album, Fragile (both in 1971), Close to the Edge (1972), Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973), Relayer (1974) and Going for the One (1977). The rise of punk rock at the end of the decade led to a decline in creativity and sales; in 1980, Anderson and Wakeman left the band and the album Drama featuring Downes and new vocalist Trevor Horn was released. The following year, all band members except Howe and Downes left the band due to personal and musical differences; instead of continuing as Yes, they disbanded the group and created Asia.\nYes reformed in 1982 with Anderson, Squire, White, original keyboardist Kaye and guitarist Trevor Rabin and adopted a more pop rock sound. Their sales peaked across the decade with 90125 (1983), which spawned the US number one single \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", and Big Generator (1987). The tour in support of Union (1991), which amalgamated members of Yes and Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, was a commercial success that featured an eight-man line-up (instead of a quintet). Subsequent albums and singles have been commercially unsuccessful. The band toured worldwide between 1997 and 2004 that included their 30th and 35th anniversary shows. After a four-year hiatus due to health issues from Anderson and Wakeman, Yes resumed touring after replacing them with Benoît David and Oliver Wakeman respectively. In 2011 they released Fly from Here featuring Downes, who returned on keyboards after 30 years, and the following year David left the band due to illness and was replaced by Davison from band Glass Hammer.\nYes are one of the most popular, influent and critically acclaimed acts in the history of the progressive genre, and have influenced bands such as Dream Theater. Nine of their twenty studio albums have reached the top ten in either the UK or the US charts, with two reaching the number one spot in the UK. They have sold 13.5 million certified units in the US.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Mario Mims (born May 19, 1981 in Memphis, Tennessee), better known by his stage name Yo Gotti, is an American rapper signed to Cash Money Records. Formerly known as Lil Yo in the 90's, he released his first album, From Da Dope Game 2 Da Rap Game, in 2000. Since then he has released 2001's Self-Explanatory, 2003's Life, 2006's Back 2 Da Basics, 2008's Cocaine Muzik, 2009's CM2 (Cocaine Muzik 2 hosted by DJ Drama), and The Pyrex King: Street Runnaz Special Edition.  As one of the six epicenters of Southern hip hop, Memphis has always had a thriving underground capable of producing major platinum superstars such as Eightball & MJG, 3-6 Mafia and Project Pat,Skip a.k.a Gianni Booker. All of the above-mentioned artists at one point in time literally dominated the city's underground rap scene before going on to become national superstars. Next up to bat is Yo Gotti, M-Town's current underground rap kingpin. Like his namesake John Gotti, the Memphis based rapper has been running the Southern underground scene with an iron fist for the past. Known and respected throughout the South for his skill and finesse on the microphone, Yo Gotti is one the South's most respected young rappers. Born Mario Mims, Yo Gotti grew up in the infamous Ridge Crest Apartments in a North Memphis neighborhood called Frazier. His childhood was typical for a poor ghetto youth in the Deep South. Raised in a family of hustlers and exposed to hard times 24 hours a day the Tennessee rap titan soon turned to the only thing that he knew could get him paid, hustling. \"Being from the hood things like hustling will come your way,\" says Yo Gotti. \"Everybody in my family hustled in some kinda way.\" Ironically, hustling is what ultimately led Yo Gotti to rapping. Taking his cue from Memphis rap legends such as Eightball & MJG, Al Kapone, Gangsta Black, Triple 6 Mafia and Kingpin Skinny Pimp, all of whom he lists as influences, Yo Gotti released his own underground tape entitled, Youngster on the Come Up and placed it on consignment at local mom & pop record stores as well as hustling it out the trunk. The tape sold like hotcakes on the street and made Yo Gotti the hottest rapper on the streets of Memphis. From the Dope Game to the Rap Game, Yo Gotti's sophomore effort sold so well that Select-O-Hits, a local based independent distributor offered him a small deal and the Memphis rapper more than doubled his fan base with absolutely no marketing or promotions. Soon he found himself ranked among the city's top rappers. In addition to being featured on the cover of Murderdog Magazine along side his idols Kingpin Skinny Pimp and Al Kapone his record From the Dope Game to the Rap Game made the list for the magazine's top independent record for the year 2000. Two years later he inked a distribution deal with TVT Records and released the critically acclaimed album Life, which did respectable numbers for an independent label. \"It sold about 40 or 50,000, with no promotions or video,\" says Yo Gotti. \"That record did what it did on its own.\" But as the old saying goes when one door is closed another opened. Gotti's reputation as the king of Memphis continued to spread and that eventually led him to a production deal with Cash Money/Universal records for his group the Block Burnaz. With his TVT sophomore album entitled Back 2 Da Basics, Yo Gotti returns with the same hardcore street flavor that his die-hard fans have come to know and love, only this time around the true king of Memphis has elevated his game a bit. Given the fact that his last record didn't do the type of big number he'd hope for you'd think that Yo Gotti would switch up his style to reach a larger audience. Right? Wrong! According to Gotti his street credibility with his underground fans means more to him than gold or platinum status. \"The one thing that you have to understand is that when you create a fan base off of street product the last thing you wanna do is disrespect them by changing because of the record companies and stuff like that. When you do that you change what created you. To me it is very important that I keep in tune with the people that helped to sell 40,000 records independently. That's why I call my record Back 2 Da Basics.\" Produced by DJ Thoomp, Mannie Fresh, Carlos Brody and newcomers Street Tunes, Back 2 Da Basics offers fans a gritty, insider's view into the real streets of Memphis as seen through the eyes of Yo Gotti. Nowhere is this viewpoint more intense than on \"Full Time,\" the amped up lead single -and featured in the MTV Films' Hustle & Flow movie - with a thunderous bass and intoxicating beat that espouses Gotti's formula to success -hustle full time. \"A lotta cats wanna be a rapper or a street hustler but they don't wanna put in the time that it takes,\" says Yo Gotti. \"They want the money and the cars and the girls, but they don't wanna work hard for it. But to be successful at anything you gotta grind for it.\" On the song \"Mama We Gone Be Alright,\" he waxes introspective by reflecting on all of the hard times that he and his family have suffered through the years and offers her hope-filled words encouragement. \"Mama We Gone Be Alright\" along with the gripping tune \"My Story\" emerges as two of the most interesting songs on Back 2 Da Basics. These three titles along with club banging songs like \"Shorty\" featuring Baby make Back 2 Da Basics one of the best albums of the year.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Jeffrey Williams (born August 9, 1992), better known by his stage name Young Thug, is an American rapper from Atlanta, Georgia. He is known for the single \"Stoner\", as well as his collaborations with fellow Southern rappers, such as Rich Homie Quan, Birdman, Waka Flocka Flame, Gucci Mane, Young Scooter, Shy Glizzy, Migos, Travi$ Scott and T.I. Young Thug signed a record deal with Gucci Mane's 1017 Brick Squad Records, an Asylum/Atlantic imprint, in early 2013. He gained major recognition in 2014, after being featured on a string of singles, including \"About the Money\" and \"Lifestyle\", the latter of which peaked at number 16 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. \n\nEarly life:\nYoung Thug was born Jeffrey Williams on August 9, 1992, in Atlanta, Georgia; the second youngest of his ten siblings. Williams is from Sylvan Hills, a neighborhood in Atlanta (Zone 3). \n\nMusic career:\n\n2011-2013: Early career and record deal:\nAfter releasing the first three installments of his mixtape series I Came From Nothing throughout 2011 and 2012, Young Thug caught the attention of fellow Atlanta-based rapper Gucci Mane, who went on to sign Young Thug to his label 1017 Brick Squad Records, an Asylum/Atlantic imprint, in 2013. Thug subsequently released his first project on the label, his fourth mixtape, 1017 Thug. The mixtape was met with positive reviews from music critics, which noted it for its original style. 1017 Thug was included in a number of year-end lists for 2013, such as Pitchfork's Albums of the Year: Honorable Mention and Complex‍ '​s The 50 Best Albums of 2013.FACT called it the best mixtape of 2013,Rolling Stone placed it at number five on their 10 Best Mixtapes of 2013 and The Guardian placed it among The Five Best Mixtapes of 2013. \nYoung Thug's song \"Picacho\", was noted as one of the standout tracks from the mixtape, although it was not released as a single, the song was included on a number of 2013 year-end lists, such as Rolling Stone‍ '​s 100 Best Songs of 2013, Pitchfork's The Top 100 Tracks of 2013, and Spin‍ '​s 50 Best Songs of 2013. \nIn July 2013, Complex included him in their list of 25 New Rappers to Watch Out For. In October 2013, Young Thug released his commercial debut single \"Stoner\". The song spawned a number of unofficial remixes by several rappers, including Wale, Jim Jones, Jadakiss, Iamsu! and Trick-Trick, among others. Thug expressed his disapproval for the remixes, commenting \"If you feel like my song isn't tough enough to the point where you have to freestyle... Don't think I'm happy that you're doing it because of who you are. I'm ready for war.\" His song \"Danny Glover\" also received a number of remixes by Waka Flocka Flame and Nicki Minaj, among others. In December 2013, Thug performed at Fool's Gold Day Off show in Miami, among Danny Brown, Trick Daddy and Travis Scott. \n\n2014-present: Rise to popularity and label issues:\nOn January 18, 2014, Young Thug revealed that he was offered $1.5 million to sign to Future's Freebandz record label and is uncertain about his current label status with 1017 Brick Squad Records. In March 2014, Young Thug's affiliation with Cash Money Records and its chief executive officer (CEO) Birdman, resulted in much speculation in the media about him signing to the label. However, the label's publicist later stated this was untrue. On March 28, 2014, Ronald \"Caveman\" Rosario, director of Urban Music at 101 Distribution, cleared the situation, stating that Young Thug signed a management deal with Birdman's Rich Gang, not a record deal, and is still signed to 1017 Brick Squad. \nIn 2014, Thug also recorded several songs with Kanye West, who praised him for his ability to make songs so fast. Thug announced that he has upcoming mixtapes with Rich Homie Quan, Chief Keef and Bloody Jay. Young Thug would go on to be featured on the March 2014 cover of The Fader. On March 11, 2014, his debut single \"Stoner\", was serviced to rhythmic contemporary radio in the United States by Asylum and Atlantic Records. On March 24, 2014, Thug stated his debut album would be titled Tha Carter VI, referencing the highly acclaimed Tha Carter album series, by American hip hop superstar Lil Wayne, who has been the biggest influence in Young Thug's music career. Two days later, it was revealed that Young Thug was working on a collaborative album with American record producer Metro Boomin, which is titled Metro Thuggin and set for release in spring 2014. The first song from the project, titled \"The BLanguage\", uses elements from Canadian rapper Drake's \"The Language\", was released the same day. In April 2014, Young Thug released a new 808 Mafia-produced song titled \"Eww\", which was named one of the five best songs of the week by XXL. The song was announced to be featured on Thug's debut album, including a guest verse by rapper Drake. \nLater his affiliation with Cash Money Records caused trouble. After rapper Lil Wayne filed a $51 million lawsuit against Birdman, Wayne released a diss track, \"Coco\", aimed towards Birdman. The track imitates Thug's style. \nOn June 17, 2014, Kevin Liles confirmed that Young Thug had been officially signed to his and Lyor Cohen's label 300 Entertainment. On July 1, 2014, Asylum Records and Atlantic Records officially released Young Thug's 2013 fan-favorite song \"Danny Glover\", re-titling it \"2 Bitches\". Also on July 1, Mass Appeal Records released \"Old English\", the first single from their compilation album Mass Appeal Vol. 1, which features Young Thug alongside fellow American rappers ASAP Ferg and Freddie Gibbs. On October 16, 2014, the first single from Cash Money Records Rich Gang 2 compilation, was released titled \"Take Kare,\" featuring Young Thug and Lil Wayne. The December 4, 2014 issue of Rolling Stone called Young Thug the \"most exciting new voice of hip-hop\" and \"hip-hop's new crown prince.\" At the end of the year, music critic Robert Christgau named Black Portland, Young Thug's collaborative mixtape with Bloody Jay, the fourth best album of 2014. \nThug's debut album was said to be named Tha Carter VI, a continuation of Lil Wayne's upcoming album, Tha Carter V. He said he plans to carry on the torch, when Lil Wayne said he planned to retire after the release of Tha Carter V. Lil Wayne, however, wasn't happy about the tribute, telling the audience of a show in April 2015 to \"stop listening\" to Young Thug. After claiming he's been threatened with lawsuits, Young Thug announced that he was changing the title to Barter 6 and that it would be a mixtape rather than his debut album. \n\nArtistry:\n\nMusical style:\nThug is known for his eccentric and diverse, sing-song style.XXL called him a \"rap weirdo\" and \"the standout guest appearance in Gucci Mane's Trap God 2 and Waka Flocka Flame's DuFlocka Rant 2\", commenting that \"Thug's charisma, unhinged flow and hooks make his music intriguing.\" Pitchfork also called his style \"extraordinarily distinctive\" and wrote that \"What Young Thug brings to the table, then, isn't just a weird, experimental approach to rapping, but presence, persona, mystique, and, potentially, star power.\"The Fader described his music, saying \"In a typical Young Thug verse, he slurs, shouts, whines and sings, feverishly contorting his voice into a series of odd timbres like a beautifully played but broken wind instrument.\" Thug usually uses Auto-Tune in his songs. \n\nInfluences:\nYoung Thug has cited American rapper Lil Wayne, as his biggest idol and influence. In an interview with Complex magazine he says, \"I want to get in the studio with Wayne more than anybody in the world.\" \n\nPersonal life:\nOn February 26, 2014, Young Thug was arrested in Atlanta for possession of a controlled substance, driving without a seat belt, reckless conduct, and reckless driving.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "ZZ Top is an American rock band from Houston, Texas. Formed in 1969, the group consists of Billy Gibbons (guitar and vocals), Dusty Hill (bass and vocals), and Frank Beard (percussion). ZZ Top's early sound was rooted in blues but eventually grew to exhibit contemporary influences. Throughout their career they have maintained a sound based on Hill's and Beard's rhythm section support, accentuated by Gibbons' guitar and vocal style. Their lyrics often gave evidence of band's humor and thematically focus on personal experiences and sexual innuendos.\nZZ Top formed its initial lineup in 1969, consisting of Gibbons, Anthony Barajas (bass and keyboards) and Peter Perez (drums and percussion). After several incarnations, Hill and Beard joined within the following year. Molded into a professional act by manager Bill Ham, they were subsequently signed to London Records and released their debut album. They were successful as live performers, becoming known to fans as \"that little ol' band from Texas\", and their 1973 album Tres Hombres, according to AllMusic, propelled the band to national attention and \"made them stars\". In 1979, after returning from a one-and-a-half year break of touring, the group reinvented themselves with their hit album Degüello and the accompanying tour. ZZ Top incorporated New Wave and punk influences into their sound and performances, and embraced a more iconic image, with Gibbons and Hill sporting chest-length beards and sunglasses. Similar experimentation continued for the remainder of the 1980s and 1990s with varying levels of success. On their 2003 album Mescalero, ZZ Top adopted a more contemporary sound while maintaining their influences from their earlier musical pursuits.\nMaintaining the same members for over forty years, ZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and are among the most popular rock groups, having sold more than 50 million albums worldwide, half of this in the United States alone. They have won three VMAs, and in 2004, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. VH1 ranked ZZ Top at number 44 in its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\". They have performed at many charity events and raised $1 million for the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale, Mississippi.",

The group was part of Queen Latifah's Flavor Unit collective.  They released the follow up album Saturday Night in 1997. The release featured the hit single \"Request Line.\" A remix with different lyrics and raps by Queen Latifah followed.  Given a high-profile spot on the all-star compilation Roll Wit tha Flava as their first recording opportunity, Zhané lived up to the pressure and came away with one of the hip-hop party anthems of all time, \"Hey, Mr. DJ.\" Jean Norris and Renee Neufville initially met while both were studying music at Philadelphia's Temple University (Norris is originally from Rhode Island, Neufville from Jamaica). After meeting Naughty by Nature member Kay Gee, Zhané impressed the producer enough to go right into the studio to record for Roll Wit tha Flava. When \"Hey, Mr. DJ\" was released as a separate single as well, it hit number six on the pop charts and earned the group a contract with Motown in 1994. Their debut album, Pronounced Jah-Nay, produced two further Top 40 hits (\"Groove Thang,\" \"Sending My Love\") and went gold by the end of the year. Zhané kept busy during 1995-1996 with spots on tracks by Busta Rhymes and De La Soul as well as new songs of their own on the NFL Jams and NBA 50th Anniversary compilations and the soundtracks to Higher Learning and A Low Down Dirty Shame -- the latter, \"Shame,\" became their fourth Top 40 hit. Norris and Neufville returned with a new LP in 1997, co-produced by Kay Gee, Eddie F., and themselves. It peaked just outside the Top 40.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Zoé is a Mexican rock band, that's not afraid of experimenting, with a modern sound, an eclectic style, some British influences & overall, their music's sophisticated without loss of rock energy. Their lyrics cover many subjects / feelings, with the same level of sophistication that their music shows, plus honesty. They usually write songs in Spanish, sometimes in English or a combination of both languages.  They began as a band in 1994; as time went by, the band changed members several times until the definite line-up stuck in 1997 with León Larregui (vocals and guitar), Sergio Acosta (guitar), Beto Cabrera (drums), Ángel Mosqueda (bass) and Chucho Báez (keyboards). Then the band made a demo and many gigs on their own with the little resources that they had; with all that, Zoé began to call the attention of the Hispanic radio stations in the U.S. Later in 1998, Zoé signed a record deal with Sony Music Mexico and began making their first record in 2000; this album, self titled, came out and quickly became a favourite of the audience in Mexico; after that, the band performed songs in soundracks of movies such as 'Amar Te Duele', 'Ladies Night' and 'The Dreamer'.  Fast forward to 2003. Zoé, along with producer Phil Vinall (Placebo, Elastica, Pulp), recorded their second album called 'Rocanlover', which became more successful than the first one thanks to hit songs like 'Peace & Love' and 'Veneno', which aired in several TV countdowns.  In 2005, after three years of working together, Zoé left Sony Music because of the lack of real interest that this record label had in them and signed a new deal with Noiselab; with a newfound belief in record labels, Zoé made an EP called 'The Room', which debuted at the top of the rankings in Mexico. This EP includes, among others, the song 'Dead' (first single); also,are including \"She Comes\" and \"Morning Watts\" as new songs  and also some remixes of \"Dead\" by great electronic artists from Mexico such as Sonido Lasser Drakkar or Los Dynamite, plus a couple of videos.  On July 12th, 2006; Zoé (now wih Rodrigo Guardiola in the drums) presented their more recent production, \"Memo Rex Commander y el Corazón atómico de la Vía Láctea\", a sophisticate, layered production, which tops several magazines' rankings. Both Zoé and producer Phil Vinall worked very hard in Tornillo, Texas, a remote town in the desert, to get \"Memo Rex\" finished.  In fall 2006, Zoé headlined the Rockampeonato Tour, along with other Noiselab signees like Los Dynamite and Los Odio!, which held shows at cities like Mérida, Guadalajara and many others. This is the biggest tour Zoé has been a part of since they were formed.  In 2007 Zoé recorded \"281107\", a live album that celebrates their first 10 years as a band, it was recorded on the Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City, this recording went platinum pretty quickly which is something unusual for live recordings in Mexico. On November 11th 2008 \"Repileptric\" Zoé's seventh studio album was released.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "New Orleans rap duo $uicideboy$ combined their talents in 2014, but the pair were already well-acquainted. The cousins -- Ruby da Cherry and $lick $loth -- grew up together, white kids in black neighborhoods on the east and west banks of the Crescent City. However, they initially veered down different paths. Ruby (aka Suicide Leopard) dabbled in punk rock, influenced by the Misfits, Minor Threat, and Leftover Crack. Meanwhile, $lick (aka Suicide Christ) was a DJ and songwriter. Once they joined forces, the result was a dark blend of horrorcore glitch-trap bubbling with booming bass, ominous atmospherics, and occultish, drugged-out rhymes. Signed to G59 Records, the Boy$ released the ambitious ten-part series, Kill Your$elf. With titles like The $uicide $aga, The $eppuku $aga, and Re$urrection, $uicideboy$ layered their twisted raps over short tracks, releasing additional EPs like Black $uicide (with Black Smurf), Grey Sheep, G.R.E.Y.G.O.D.S., and My Liver Will Handle What My Heart Can't in 2015. By 2016, with SXSW and international shows under their belts, the recordings continued, notching nearly 30 full efforts within two years. Radical $uicide, their 29th release, arrived in the summer of 2016. The five-track EP produced by Getter peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Rap charts. ~ Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Daniel Hernandez (born May 8, 1996), known professionally as 6ix9ine (pronounced \"six nine\") or Tekashi69, is an American rapper and Internet personality. Hernandez is known for his distinctive rainbow-themed look, aggressive style of rapping, public feuds with fellow celebrities, legal issues, and controversial public persona. All 10 of his singles have charted on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nHernandez rose to mainstream fame in late 2017 with the release of his debut single \"Gummo\", which was certified platinum by the RIAA. In early 2018, Hernandez released his debut mixtape, Day69, which debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 album chart. He later earned his first top-five entry on the Billboard Hot 100 with \"Fefe\", featuring Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz, which peaked at number three on the chart. His debut studio album, Dummy Boy, was released on November 27, 2018, after being delayed a week earlier due to his arrest.\n\nHernandez pled guilty to using a 13-year-old child in a sexual performance in 2015. He was arrested in November 2018 on racketeering and firearm charges, among others, for which he is facing a possible life sentence in prison.\n\nEarly life\nDaniel Hernandez was born on May 8, 1996 in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York City to a mother originally from Atlixco, Puebla, Mexico and a Puerto Rican father.\n\nHe was raised with his older brother by his parents until he was 13, when his father was shot dead steps away from the family home. Emotionally disturbed by the passing of his father, Hernandez started to act out and was eventually expelled from school in the 8th grade for bad behavior. Rather than continue his education, he started working various odd jobs such as working as a busboy to help his mother financially. Hernandez also dealt drugs to supplement his income, most notably selling cannabis and heroin on the streets while working at a local Brooklyn bodega. He was eventually arrested for his criminal activities and sentenced to prison time at Rikers Island, where he began to associate himself with the Nine Trey Gangsters, a prison subset of the Bloods street gang. Hernandez began his career as a rapper in 2014, releasing songs such as \"69\" and \"Scumlife\". Other early songs were taken down by YouTube.\n\nMusic career\n2014–2016: Early career\nHernandez began releasing rap songs in 2014. Over the next three years, he released multiple tracks and videos with titles such as \"Scumlife\", \"Yokai\", and \"Hellsing Station\", drawing attention for his aggressive rapping style and use of anime as music video visuals. Many of his early songs were released by FCK THEM, a music label based in Slovakia. Gathering fame as an internet meme for his rainbow-dyed hair and rainbow-plated grills, he eventually became an associate of fellow New York rapper ZillaKami. They later feuded after Hernandez allegedly stole instrumentals and songs they had made together.\n\n\"Poles1469\", released in April 2017, featured Hernandez alongside Ohio-based artist Trippie Redd and was the first of Hernandez's songs to receive significant views on YouTube.\n\n2017–present: Breakthrough and Day69\nHernandez rose to prominence on social media due to a July 2017 Instagram post that went viral on both Reddit and Twitter. Hernandez's eccentric appearance (rainbow-dyed hair, a rainbow grill, and multiple versions of the number 69 tattooed on his body) turned him into an internet meme.\n\nHernandez's commercial debut single \"Gummo\" was released on November 10, 2017, and eventually peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was certified platinum by the RIAA on March 5, 2018. His next single, \"Kooda\", debuted at number 61 on the Hot 100 the week of December 23, 2017. On January 14, 2018, Hernandez released his third single, \"Keke\", with Fetty Wap and A Boogie wit da Hoodie, which also charted on the Hot 100.\n\nShortly afterward, Hernandez announced his debut mixtape, titled Day69. The mixtape was released on February 23, 2018, and debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 album chart with 55,000 album-equivalent units, of which 20,000 were pure sales. According to Jon Caramanica of The New York Times, the tape was an outgrowth of the \"SoundCloud rap explosion\", and was notable for its willingness to deviate from hip-hop's prevailing sound. After the release of Day69, two songs from the album, \"Billy\" and \"Rondo\" both debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, with \"Billy\" peaking at number 50 and \"Rondo\" at number 73.\n\nIn April 2018, Hernandez released \"Gotti\", a remix of a feature he did for artist Packman titled \"Got it, Got it\". The song's video was released on April 16, 2018, and involved Hernandez donating bundles of $100 bills to poor citizens in the Dominican Republic. The song was added to Day69 as a deluxe song and debuted at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 before dropping off the following week, making it his sixth consecutive Hot 100 entry.\n\nHernandez stirred up controversy in May 2018 when he was involved in a shooting with the entourage of fellow New York rapper Casanova as part of a feud; this led to Hernandez losing a $5 million headphone deal and being banned from the Barclays Center. After the shooting, Hernandez stopped releasing music for several months, before releasing \"Tati\", featuring DJ Spinking in June, which debuted at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn July 2018, Hernandez released his eighth single, \"Fefe\", featuring Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz; the single debuted at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 before peaking at number three in its second week, marking 6ix9ine's highest entry on the chart and his first single to reach the top five of the Hot 100. \"Fefe\" was later certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. His subsequent singles, \"Bebe\" and \"Stoopid\", also proved successful and both reached the top 30 of the Hot 100.\n\nIn early October 2018, Hernandez was featured on the song \"Aulos Reloaded\" with French house DJ Vladimir Cauchemar and \"Kick\" with Danish singer Jimilian.\n\nOn November 7, 2018, it was announced tha his debut studio album, Dummy Boy, was to be released on November 23, but on November 21, it was announced that the album would be postponed. The album was ultimately released without notice on November 27, on all streaming services.\n\nNotable feuds\nIn April 2017, Hernandez and Trippie Redd released their first collaboration, \"Poles1469\", and in July 2017, they released another, \"Owee.\" Later that year, upon seeing a post from a Twitter account claiming Hernandez was a pedophile following the release of images and information by fellow rapper and 6ix9ine detractor ZillaKami, Trippie Redd denounced Hernandez, saying, \"I'm sorry brozay (sic), 1400 don't promote pedophiles... If we give niggas clout, we give niggas clout. It was an accident.\" On November 11, 2017, following a series of barbs the two traded on social media, Redd was attacked in the lobby of a New York hotel and blamed Hernandez and his crew in an Instagram live video. Hernandez later insinuated his involvement in an Instagram live video, saying, \"I don't know what's going on, but your chin is bruised up. You can't just be out here calling people gay, bro. Can't be supporting false accusations, you can't be ranting on Live talking about New York. Fuck these niggas talking about, New York this, New York that, like, you just can't do that bro. You should put some ice on that chin, it's bruised up. I feel bad bro... I just want you to be my friend again,\" before proceeding to sing the hook from \"Poles1469.\" He was referencing a post by Trippie Redd that showed Hernandez holding hands with another man with a caption insinuating Hernandez was gay. In February 2018, Hernandez was assaulted by several men outside a Los Angeles airport shortly after arguing with Trippie Redd on Instagram. Their feud continued to escalate with mutual Internet trolling. Hernandez later accused Redd over Instagram Live of having pedophilic sexual relations with fellow rapper Danielle \"Bhad Bhabie\" Bregoli, who was a minor at the time. Trippie Redd denied the allegations, and reiterated Hernandez's conviction for use of a child in sexual performance. Bregoli also took to Instagram Live to deny the claims, but admitted the two had kissed in the past, saying, \"We kissed but it wasn't that serious and he was 17 at the time.\" After the dissolution of Redd’s relationship with his then-girlfriend Alexandria Laveglia, known professionally as Aylek$, Hernandez started posting videos of himself with her, hinting at sexual activity between the two, to the ignominy of Trippie Redd. After Hernandez’s November 2018 federal arrest on RICO charges, Trippie Redd mocked Hernandez’s imprisonment in a video of him dancing to the tune of Akon's 2004 hit single \"Locked Up\", mimicking a jail scenario.\n\nThroughout 2018, Hernandez was involved in feuds with a number of Chicago drill artists from the GloGang (Glory Boyz Entertainment) collective, including Chief Keef, Lil Reese, and Tadoe (Chief Keef's cousin), stemming from domestic abuse and relationship issues relating to fellow rapper Cuban Doll, who was in a romantic relationship with Tadoe but also friendly with Hernandez. The two continued to feud on social media, with Hernandez posting a video of his semi-romantic vacation to Hawaii with Cuban Doll to Instagram, and driving up to Chief Keef’s old neighborhood and calling him out, as well as contacting the mother of one of Chief Keef’s sons and recording himself buying her designer clothes and verbally taunting him, and later receiving fellatio from her. On May 8, 2018, Trippie Redd previewed the song \"I Kill People\" on Instagram, featuring Chief Keef and Tadoe, which was aimed as a diss toward 6ix9ine and Cuban Doll. On June 2, 2018, Chief Keef was fired upon outside the W Hotel in New York City but not hit; no injuries resulted from the incident. Due to the ongoing feud, Hernandez was confirmed to be under investigation by the New York Police Department for possible involvement with the incident, despite being in Los Angeles at the time.\n\nPersonal and legal issues\nSee also: Trial of 6ix9ine\nHernandez has a daughter, Saraiyah (born March 20, 2013), with Sara Molina. On the night of November 11, 2018, just days before his arrest on RICO charges, Hernandez allegedly struck Molina once in the face during an argument after being confronted about cheating on her. She questioned him after finding provocative text messages from Jade, a woman Hernandez was seeing. The incident left Molina with a bruised lip.\n\nHernandez's criminal behavior has been the subject of controversy, most notably relating to a child sex case from 2015. In October 2015, Hernandez pled guilty to a felony count of use of a child in a sexual performance. He was charged with three counts of the offense after a February 2015 incident in which he had physical contact with a 13-year-old girl and later distributed videos of the incident online as part of a music video. Three videos are described in the criminal complaint against Hernandez. In the first, \"the child engages in oral sexual intercourse with the separately charged defendant Taquan Anderson, while the defendant, Daniel Hernandez, stands behind the child making a thrusting motion with his pelvis and smacking her on her buttocks. The child is nude in the video.\" The other videos show the child sitting on Hernandez's lap while Anderson gropes her breasts, and later sitting naked across the laps of Anderson and Hernandez.\n\nIn a November 2017 interview, Hernandez claimed to have had \"no sexual contact\" with the girl and denied knowing she was a minor. Hernandez also claimed to have been 17 at the time of the incident, though the birth date listed in the complaint against him and in his statement to the police shows he was 18.\n\nUnder his plea deal, Hernandez must obtain his GED, refrain from posting sexually explicit or violent images of women or children to social media, and not commit another crime for two years, among other injunctions. If met, the plea deal will give Hernandez three years' probation and he will not have to register as a sex offender; if not, Hernandez could face up to three years in prison. In a January 2018 court hearing, it was revealed that Hernandez had failed his GED test, but had his sentencing adjourned until April 10, 2018. The court date was later postponed, reportedly because the court did not have a copy of Hernandez's GED. Prior to his sexual misconduct charges, Hernandez served jail time as a minor for assault and the sale of heroin.\n\nOn July 12, 2018, Hernandez was arrested in New York for an outstanding warrant related to an incident where he allegedly choked a 16-year-old in Houston's Galleria mall in January 2018.\n\nIn the early morning hours of July 22, 2018, Hernandez was kidnapped, beaten, and robbed by three armed assailants in Brooklyn. He had finished shooting the music video for \"FEFE\" (featuring Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz) when the assailants grabbed him outside his home and pistol-whipped him. The robbers eventually took over $750,000 in custom jewelry and approximately $35,000 in cash. Hernandez escaped from their vehicle and summoned police help via a stranger. He was taken to the hospital.\n\nDue to his continuing legal problems in light of his plea bargain, the Manhattan district attorney's office announced Hernandez could face up to three years in prison and possible sex offender registration for his 2015 case, but he was instead sentenced to four years' probation starting in October 2018, with one clause being that he cannot utter the phrase “Treyway” in public as it was deemed to promote gang activity, as well as 1,000 hours of community service. On October 27, 2018, two members of Hernandez's entourage were involved in a shooting in Manhattan and were subsequently charged with gang assault.\n\nOn November 10, 2018, TMZ released surveillance footage of two men opening fire at the set of Hernandez's as well as Kanye West and Nicki Minaj's music video shoot in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nOn November 18, 2018, Hernandez, his former manager Kifano \"Shotti\" Jordan, and three other associates were arrested. Hernandez is charged with federal RICO and firearms charges, including conspiracy to murder and armed robbery, and faces up to life in prison. He is allegedly part of \"a violent sect of the Bloods\" known as the Nine Trey Gangsters. Hernandez’s attorney, Lance Lazzaro, advocated for bail for his client on the condition that Hernandez surrender his passport, pay a little under $2 million for bail, and be placed under house arrest, but the judge denied bail, keeping Hernandez in custody on the grounds that he may still be a danger to the community even if those bail conditions were met. Hernandez’s legal team plans to appeal that decision. He was held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn under general population before being moved to another facility.",

The band consists of vocalist Jeremy McKinnon, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Neil Westfall, bassist Joshua Woodard, percussion and drummer Alex Shelnutt and lead guitarist Kevin Skaff.\n\nSigning with Indianola Records for their first album, And Their Name Was Treason, Scruggs was replaced by Shelnutt in 2006. Later that year the band recorded For Those Who Have Heart with Victory Records. They embarked on several tours of the UK and U.S. and played at several festivals, before recording and releasing Homesick. While promoting Homesick on tour, Denney was replaced by Skaff. Soon after releasing their next album, What Separates Me from You, the band went on a worldwide tour to promote it. In 2011, the band was involved in a lawsuit with Victory Records over their recording contract, which was settled in October 2013. The band released their fifth album, Common Courtesy, the same month.",

Aged 19, she has been writing songs for almost half her life, crafting dark pop music of rare depth. Aurora Aksnes was born on 15 June 1996 in Bergen, Norway. Her earliest musical memory is of finding an electric piano in her parents’ attic and being fascinated by the music she could produce. Her parents never pushed her to pursue music either as a career or as a hobby but as Aurora grew older, she moved on from mimicking classical music to composing her own. She cites renowned songwriters Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan as influences. It was one year after her debut performance at school that Aurora first came to the attention of anyone outside of her assembly hall. One of Aurora’s friends heard the song, asked for a copy and then uploaded it onto a Norwegian streaming site. Made Management heard the track and quickly began working with Aurora . She signed with the management company shortly before signing with Glassnote and Decca in October 2014.\nJim Vorel of pastemagazine.com wrote \" Aksnes has an x-factor that one can’t quite look away from. Her arms and hands are always waving, and it’s difficult to decide whether she’s warding off bad vibes or if she’s knowingly becoming a siren, casting her spell over the audience. She’s never been to New York before, but most audience members in the sea of spooning, slow-dancing Brooklyn residents seem to know her quite well. We undoubtedly haven’t heard the last of Aurora.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Artista mexicano, hijo de Vicente Fernández. Excelente interprete de rancheras y musica melódica latina. Comenzó interpretando temas con mariachi y música tradicional mexicana. Últimamente canta también música pop.  Alejandro Fernández (born April 24, 1971) is a popular Latin Grammy-winning Mexican singer nicknamed as \"El Potrillo\" (\"The Little Colt\") by the media and his fans. ] Alejandro originally specialized in traditional, earthy forms of Mexican folk and country music, such as mariachi and ranchera. However, his more recent work has focused on mainstream pop music. He is the son of Vicente Fernández, also a popular Mexican country singer. His nickname \"El Potrillo\" (The Little Colt) was given to him by the media and his fans because of his being the son of Vicente, who is considered the most popular charro in Mexico.   Career  Born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, he trained as an architect but turned to singing in 1991, encouraged by his father. A year later, he released his first album, titled Alejandro Fernandez. Since then, he has recorded 18 albums and sold a reported 15 million records, working with producers such as Emilio Estefan, Jr. and Kike Santander. His first public appearance was in 1976, when his father presented him on one of his shows, he was meant to perform the song \"Alejandra\". In the middle of the song he forgot the lyrics, started crying and suffered a panic attack, but then, his father got on stage and helped him singing along the song, making it a very touching moment between Alejandro and his father.  In 1992, Alejandro Fernández released his debut, self-titled album, launching one of the most prolific, successful and memorable careers in Latin music. Since then, the son of legendary ranchera singer Vicente Fernández has done what few progeny of famous parents have ever been able to achieve: He's followed in his father's footsteps, but at the same time, he's carved out his own, separate path, thanks to his skilled vocals and an unparalleled stage presence. Fernández also has portrayed the lead role in zapata: El sueño del héroe, a 2004 movie about the Mexican revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata by filmmaker Alfonso Arau, which proved to be one of the greatest disappointments in the Nuevo Cine Mexicano era, spending 7 million dollars in production and publicity but faring poorly at the box office.  While most Latin acts talk about crossovers from Spanish to English, Alejandro is one of only a handful of artists that have managed to become a superstar by crossing over from the world of traditional ranchera music to the world of pop. That duality began in 1997 with Me Estoy Enamorando, a collaboration with producer Emilio Estefan that sold 3 million copies worldwide and established Alejandro as an international star. In 1998, Alejandro performed along with the operatic tenor Placido Domingo and the French singer Patricia Kaas in Christmas in Vienna VI.  In 2004, A Corazón Abierto reunites Alejandro with Grammy-winning producer and songwriter Kike Santander, who penned his greatest hits from \"Me Estoy Enamorando\". But it also finds him singing the songs of a bold new generation of songwriters, including Gian Marco, Leonel García (one half of pop duo Sin Bandera), Reyli Barba (former member of pop band Elefante) and Mexican group Tres De Copas.  \"A Corazón Abierto\" is about love, but it's hardly a staid album. Quite the opposite. Under the guidance of producers Kike Santander and Aureo Baqueiro, the sound of this record is taken beyond the traditional and is an album rich in instrumentation--rippling guitars, flowing strings and mariachi lines--that treads on folk, rock and ranchera elements with organic ease and conviction. The superb emotional and musical interpretations are the clincher. At times exuberant, \"A Corazón Abierto\" can also be an album of subtle understatement, unafraid to bare the singer in every sense of the word.  \"Romanticism is something that will never die\", says Alejandro Fernández, explaining his choice of songs on \"A Corazón Abierto\", his breakthrough recording about lost love, love that is never forgotten and the capacity to always love again. \"I'm super, ultra passionate. We're releasing an album that's an x-ray of myself. That's why it's titled \"A Corazón Abierto\". It was something very honest. Not naked, but something deeper than that\".  In 2005, Alejandro launches México - Madrid: En Directo Y Sin Escalas (in English: Mexico - Madrid: Nonstop). Featuring 13 tracks including one new song, this album is Fernández at his best - live and in concert! \"Produced by Aureo Baquiero and filmed in front of a live audience at Spain's Palacio de Congresos IFEMA, the production features Fernández performing some of his biggest hits accompanied by a 28-piece orchestra and some of Spain's most important voices on three of the songs: Amaia from La Oreja de Van Gogh joins him on \"Me dediqué a perderte\"; Malú duets with him on \"Contigo aprendí\", and with flamenco star Diego El Cigala perform a moving version of \"Como quien pierde una estrella\", accompanied on cajon by famed Flamenco guitarist Niño Josele. That same year, Alejandro was chosen to sing along with the tenors Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo in a special concerto celebrating the opening of the \"Forum Internacional de las Culturas\" in Monterrey. Alejandro's performance was praised by the audience. He also recorded a duet song with the tenor Mario Frangoulis called \"Hay Más\" from the album Follow Your Heart.  In 2007, launches Viento A Favor features tunes written by Leonel García and Noel Schajris (better known as emotive Latin-pop duo Sin Bandera) and Mexican singer Reyli Barba. They're all taken to wuthering heights by Fernandez's stellar vocal range, which goes from hushed whispers to booming intensity. First single \"Te Voy A Perder\" is an epic romance, and \"Amor Gitano\", a duet with performer Beyoncé Knowles. Closing tune \"Cuando Estamos Juntos\" is another surprise, an acoustic-flavored ode to simple joy.  He has five children, (Alejandro, Jr. and the twins, América and Camila) with his ex-wife, Mexican América Guinart, and two (Emiliano and Valentina) with his now ex-girlfriend, Colombian model Ximena Díaz.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Alejandro Sanz (born Alejandro Sánchez Pizarro on December 18, 1968) is a Spanish singer-songwriter and musician. For his work, Sanz has won a total of fifteen Latin Grammy Awards and three Grammy Awards. He has won the Latin Grammy for Album of the Year three times, more than any other artist. Throughout his career, he has released a total of eight studio albums and six DVDs. The singer is noted for his flamenco-influenced ballads, but he has also experimented with rock, salsa, and hip hop. Born in Madrid, Sanz began playing guitar at age seven, taking influence from his family's flamenco roots. He released his debut album at age sixteen, although he did not gain commercial success in Spain until his second release, Viviendo Deprisa.\n\nHis next two records, Si Tú Me Miras (1993) and 3 (1995) also fared well commercially, but it was his 1997 breakthrough album Más that garnered international success. El Alma al Aire followed in 2000, selling more than a million copies in its first week. In 2002, he became the first Spanish artist to record an MTV Unplugged album. His collaboration with Shakira on the single \"La Tortura\" reached number one on several charts worldwide. His albums No Es lo Mismo (2003) and El Tren de los Momentos (2006) showed Sanz experimenting with more diverse styles of music, while his most recent release, Paraíso Express (2009) served as a return to form for the musician. He signed to Universal Music Group in 2011 and released his ninth studio album, La Música No Se Toca, on September 25, 2012.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Andrea Bocelli, OMRI, OMDSM (Italian pronunciation: ; born 22 September 1958) is an Italian tenor, multi-instrumentalist and classical crossover artist. Born with poor eyesight, he became blind at the age of twelve following a football accident.\n\nSince winning the Newcomers section of the Sanremo Music Festival in 1994, Bocelli has recorded thirteen solo studio albums, of both pop and classical music, two greatest hits albums, and eight complete operas, selling over 75 million records worldwide. Thus, he is the biggest-selling solo artist in the history of classical music and has caused core classical repertoire to \"cross over\" to the top of international pop charts and into previously uncharted territory in popular culture.\n\nIn 1998, he was named one of People Magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People. In 1999, his nomination for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards marked the first, and so far only time a classical artist had been nominated in the category, since Leontyne Price, in 1961. The Prayer, his duet with Celine Dion for the animated film The Quest for Camelot, won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song and was nominated for an Academy Award in the same category. With the release of his classical album, Sacred Arias, Bocelli captured a listing in the Guinness Book of World Records, as he simultaneously held the top 3 positions on the US classical albums charts. Six of his albums have since reached the Top 10 on the Billboard 200, and a record-setting 8, have topped the classical albums charts in the United States.\n\nWith 5 million units sold worldwide, Sacred Arias became the biggest-selling classical album by a solo artist of all time, and with over 20 million copies sold worldwide, his 1997 pop album, Romanza, became the best-selling album by an Italian artist of any genre in history, as well as the best-selling album by a foreign artist in Canada, and a number of other countries in Europe and Latin America. The album's first single, \"Time to Say Goodbye\", topped charts all across Europe, including Germany, where it stayed at the top of the charts for fourteen consecutive weeks, breaking the all-time sales record, with over 3 million copies sold in the country. The single went on to sell over 12 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time.\n\nWidely regarded as both the most popular Italian and classical singer in the world, Bocelli was made a Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 2006, and on March 2, 2010, was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to Live Theater.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Avril Ramona Lavigne born 27 September 1984 is a Canadian singer-songwriter. She was born in Belleville, Ontario, but spent most of her youth in the small town of Napanee. By the age of 15, she had appeared on stage with Shania Twain; by 16, she had signed a two-album recording contract with Arista Records worth more than $2 million. In 2002, when she was 17 years old, Lavigne broke onto the music scene with her debut album Let Go.\n\nLet Go made Lavigne the youngest female soloist to reach No. 1 in the UK, and the album was certified four-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. By 2009, over 16 million copies had been sold worldwide. Her breakthrough single, \"Complicated\", peaked at No. 1 in many countries around the world, as did the album Let Go.\n\nHer second album, Under My Skin, was released in 2004 and was her first album to peak at No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200, eventually selling more than 10 million copies worldwide. The Best Damn Thing, Lavigne’s third album, was released in 2007, becoming her third No. 1 album in the UK Albums Chart and featuring her first U.S. Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 single, \"Girlfriend\".\n\nLavigne has scored six number-one singles worldwide, including \"Complicated\", \"Sk8er Boi\", \"I'm with You\", \"My Happy Ending\", \"Nobody's Home\", and \"Girlfriend\". With more than 30 million copies of her albums sold worldwide, Lavigne is one of the top-selling artists releasing albums in the U.S., with over 10.25 million copies certified by the RIAA. Her fourth studio album, Goodbye Lullaby, was released in March 2011.\n\nGoodbye Lullaby gave Lavigne her fourth top 10 album on the U.S. Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart and her third No. 1 album in both Japan and Australia. Three months after the release of Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne began work on her fifth album, which will be released on Epic Records following her departure from RCA Records.\n\nLavigne branched out from recording music, pursuing careers in feature film acting and designing clothes and perfumes. She voiced a character in the animated film, Over the Hedge, in 2006. That same year, she made her on-screen feature film debut in Fast Food Nation.\n\nIn 2008, Lavigne introduced her clothing line, Abbey Dawn, and in 2009, she released her first perfume, Black Star, which was followed by her second perfume, Forbidden Rose, in 2010 and her third perfume, Wild Rose, in 2011. In July 2006, Lavigne married her boyfriend of two years, Deryck Whibley, lead singer and guitarist for Sum 41. The marriage lasted a little over three years, and in October 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce. Whibley and Lavigne continued to work together, with Whibley producing her fourth album, as well as Lavigne's single, \"Alice\", written for Tim Burton's film Alice in Wonderland.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Bobby Ray Simmons, Jr. (born November 15, 1988), better known by his stage name B.o.B, is an American rapper, singer-songwriter and record producer. He is currently signed under the labels of Grand Hustle Records, Rebel Rock Entertainment, and Atlantic Records. His debut single \"Nothin' on You\" reached number one in both the United States and the United Kingdom. His second single \"Airplanes\" too peaked at number one in the United Kingdom and at number two in the US. His third single, \"Magic\", became B.o.B's third consecutive top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100. B.o.B was named the ninth Hottest MC in the Game of 2010 by MTV. On April 27, 2010 his debut album, B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray was released, reaching number one on the US charts.\nSimmons was born November 15, 1988 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He played the trumpet in his school band from elementary school through high school. Although his parents wanted him to continue his education, Simmons decided in sixth grade that he wanted to pursue a music career. His father, a pastor, disapproved of his son's choices until he realized that Simmons was using music as a form of therapy and a creative outlet. Simmons later reflected on his experience, saying, \"They’ve always supported me. They got my first keyboard to make beats on and they helped me out getting equipment here and there. But it was kind of hard for them to really understand what I was really trying to accomplish.\" B.o.B attended Columbia High School in Decatur, Georgia.\nAfter meeting his mentor and co-manager, B. Rich, in 2002 at 14 years of age, B.o.B sold his first beat to former Slip-n-Slide recording artist Citti for a song titled \"I'm the Cookie Man.\" Meanwhile B.o.B felt he had made it: \"I went and blew all of my money on fast stuff like a chain and ballin'. Soon I was broke again, but I learned two important things from it; make sure I save my money and that I was hooked on music.\" Back to square one, B.o.B continued performing at open mics and underground venues to perfect his craft. In 2006, because he was underage, B. Rich helped sneak B.o.B into Club Crucial, a night club owned by Atlanta rapper T.I.. There, B.o.B performed a song titled \"Cloud 9\", a self -produced, spoken word-like ode to marijuana. In attendance was producer and industry veteran, T.J. Chapman, CEO of TJ's DJ's. TJ Chapman agreed to co-manage B.o.B, which only a month later led to B.o.B's signing with Atlantic Records and subsidiary imprint Rebel Rock, run by Florida producer Jim Jonsin. His first single for Atlantic, 2007's \"Haterz Everywhere\", reached the top five of Billboard's Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop singles chart. Along with his solo production career, B.o.B is part of a production/rap group called HamSquad, along with Playboy Tre, TJ Chapman, and B. Rich.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Backstreet Boys (sometimes referred to as BSB) are an American vocal group, formed in Orlando, Florida in 1993. The band consists of A. J. McLean, Howie Dorough, Brian Littrell, Nick Carter, and Kevin Richardson. They rose to fame with their debut international album, Backstreet Boys (1996). In the following year, they released their second international album, Backstreet's Back (1997) and their debut album in the United States which continued the group's success worldwide. They rose to superstardom with their album Millennium (1999) and its follow-up album, Black & Blue (2000).\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus, the band regrouped and released their comeback album Never Gone (2005). Richardson left the band in 2006, several months after the conclusion of the Never Gone tour to pursue other interests. The band then recorded and released two albums as a four-piece: Unbreakable (2007) and This Is Us (2009).\nIn April 2012, the band announced that Richardson has rejoined and that they will return to London in July to continue recording their eighth studio album.\n\nThe Backstreet Boys have sold over 130 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling boy band of all time, and one of the world's best-selling music artists. According to Billboard, they are the first group since Sade to have their first seven albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200. They are also set to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2013.\n\nCousins Kevin Richardson and Brian Littrell, both of whom came from Lexington, Kentucky, initially began singing in local church choirs and festivals while they were children. Howie Dorough and A. J. McLean were natives of Orlando, Florida, who met each other and later discovered Nick Carter through auditions who joined the two for local commercials, theater, and television. The three, realizing at one audition, that they all shared a great affection for classical soul which they were able to harmonize together, decided to form a trio. Meanwhile, Richardson moved to Orlando, where he took several jobs at Disney, including a tour guide, and the roles of Aladdin and a Ninja Turtle and concentrated on music at nights. Eventually, he met Dorough, Carter, and McLean through a co-worker, and the four decided to form a group. Brian Littrell was later invited to join, turning the group into a quintet. In the course of all this, Lou Pearlman, in early 1992 had placed an ad in Orlando Sentinel announcing auditions to compose a boy band. McLean, who was the first to audition for Pearlman in his living room, became the band's first member. In January 1993, Pearlman held an open casting call during which hundreds of young performers danced and sang at his blimp hangar in Kissimmee, south of Orlando. Eventually, Nick Carter, Kevin Richardson, and Howie Dorough were selected after meeting Pearlman's expectations, and Brian Littrell was added to the band after Richardson had him audition for the band over the telephone. He flew from Kentucky to Orlando to formally join the band on April 20, 1993, and the date is regarded as their anniversary date. Pearlman decided to call the band Backstreet Boys, naming it after Orlando's Backstreet flea market. The band had its very first performance at SeaWorld Orlando in May 1993.",

The mission of Bethel Church is \"REVIVAL... the personal, regional, and global expansion of God's kingdom through His manifest presence.\"  BETHEL MUSIC was formed for the express purpose of creating corridors in the heavenly realms through the mystery of music, that facilitate deeper dimensions of God's manifest presence. His manifold reality inspires worship, ignites revelation and captivates the world.  Therefore the triune mission of BETHEL MUSIC is to:      Adore God through thanksgiving, praise and worship.     Instruct the Church with songs, hymns and spiritual songs.     And enlighten the lost with melodies of mercy.  These foundation stones have been passed down to us for more than five decades and are gaining momentum with each passing generation. Our goal is to honor the core values of our past, build a creative, catalytic culture in the present and leave a legacy for future generations.  The main pillars of BETHEL MUSIC'S core distinctives are:      God is good all the time; in fact He is even better than you can imagine.     The redemptive power of Jesus Christ transformed us from sinners to saints (at conversion), eradicated our sin nature and imparted to us His divine character.     We have been commissioned to carry His glory, make disciples OF ALL nations and bring heaven to earth, until the kingdom's of this world become the Kingdom of our God.     We've been commanded to do greater miracles then Jesus, demonstrate God's superior Kingdom, empower His supernatural people and annihilate the works of the devil.     We embrace a fantastic future, refuse to re-empower a disempowered devil and are determined to leave our children's, children's, children a world in revival.  The practical mandates of BETHEL MUSIC are facilitated through several different avenues:      Our own songwriters group, who are commissioned to create songs and sounds that carry our mission and core values, compose most of our music.     We have several schools through out the year that train, equip and deploy musicians, songwriters and producers to help accomplish our God-given mandate.     BETHEL MUSIC produces, mixes and masters songs and music videos in cooperation with other professionals in different phases of production.     We distribute songs and music videos globally through several venues including partnerships with like-minded distribution companies.     BETHEL MUSIC publishes and manages songs, distributing them through CCLI.  Closing Thoughts: Our earnest prayer is that BETHEL MUSIC would inspire a revolution that impacts the planet by reforming the Church and transforming the world.  May everything we produce be rooted in His Excellency, be inspired by His creativity and be entrenched in His Divine Nature.  And finally, may the Lord use our music to take you on a Holy Spirit journey into the very heart of God Himself!",

Big Sean signed with Kanye West's GOOD Music in 2007, and then in 2008 signed with Def Jam Recordings.\nSean Michael Anderson was born in Santa Monica, California, and he moved at two months old to west Detroit (6 Mile and Wyoming), where he was raised by his mother and grandmother. He attended Detroit Waldorf School and graduated from Cass Technical High School with a 3.7 GPA. Big Sean is often heard saying \"west side\" in his songs; he is referring to the west side of his hometown Detroit, Michigan. In his later years in high school, Sean gained a valuable relationship with Detroit hip-hop station WHTD; he would show his rhyming skills on a weekly basis as part of a rap battle contest held by the station. In 2005, Kanye West was doing a radio interview at 102.7 FM. Hearing about this, Sean headed over to the station to meet West and perform some freestyle. Initially Kanye was reluctant to hear the emcee, however he gave Sean 16 bars to rap for him. According to Big Sean, Kanye enjoyed his freestyle: \"As we get to the entrance of the radio station ... we stopped in the middle of the doorway. He starts looking at me and bobbing his head,\". After the freestyle, Sean left Kanye his demo tape. Two years later, West signed Big Sean to GOOD Music. On September 30, 2007, Big Sean released his first official mixtape Finally Famous: The Mixtape. His hit single, \"Get'cha Some\", produced by WrighTrax, attained media attention and led to articles in The Source and the Detroit Metro Times. He also recorded a music video for \"Get'cha Some\", which was directed by Hype Williams. Sean released a second mixtape hosted by Mick Boogie on April 16, 2009, called UKNOWBIGSEAN. It featured the songs \"Million Dollars\", \"Get'cha Some\" and \"Supa Dupa\". This mixtape includes 30 tracks. Sean released a third mixtape hosted by Don Cannon on August 31, 2010 called Finally Famous Vol. 3: BIG. Features include Bun B, Chip tha Ripper, Curren$y, SAYITAINTTONE, Tyga, Drake, Mike Posner, Suai, Chuck Inglish, Asher Roth, Dom Kennedy, Boldy James, and Chiddy Bang. The mixtape includes 20 tracks.\nAn unauthorized leak of his collaboration with Drake, called \"Made\" made its way onto the internet on April 30, 2010. In an interview with TheHipHopUpdate.com on May 1, Big Sean expressed his disappointment over the leak, calling it an unfinished version both musically and verse wise. Big Sean's official Facebook page confirmed that his debut album Finally Famous & Consequence's Cons TV would be released on September 14, 2010.

März 2020 in Los Angeles) was an American singer-songwriter and musician who performed and recorded from 1970 until 1985. He recorded a number of hits such as \"Lean on Me\", \"Ain't No Sunshine\", \"Use Me\", \"Just the Two of Us\", \"Lovely Day\", and \"Grandma's Hands\". His life was the subject of the 2009 documentary film Still Bill.\n\nWithers was born the youngest of six children in the small coal-mining town of Slab Fork, West Virginia. Raised in nearby Beckley, West Virginia, Withers was thirteen years old when his father died. He enlisted with the United States Navy at age eighteen and served for nine years, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs. Discharged from the Navy in 1965, he relocated to Los Angeles in 1967 for a musical career.\n\nWithers worked as an assembler for several different companies, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation, while recording demo tapes with his own money, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song \"Ain't No Sunshine\" he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "The Black Eyed Peas is an American hip hop group, consisting of rappers will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo, and singer Fergie. Originally an alternative hip hop group, they subsequently added R&B and EDM influences. Although the group was founded in Los Angeles in 1995, it was not until the release of their third album Elephunk in 2003 that they achieved high record sales. Since that time, the group has sold an estimated 76 million records (35 million albums and 41 million singles), making them one of the world's best-selling groups of all time. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the Black Eyed Peas were the second-best-selling artist/group of all time for downloaded tracks, with over 42 million sales as of the end of 2011.\nTheir first major hit was the 2003 single \"Where Is the Love?\" from Elephunk, which topped the charts in 13 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it spent seven weeks at number one and went on to become Britain's biggest selling single of 2003. Another European hit single from the album was \"Shut Up\". Their fourth album, Monkey Business, was an even bigger worldwide success, certified 4× Platinum in the U.S., and spawning four singles, \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\", \"Don't Lie\", \"My Humps\" and \"Pump It\". In 2009, the group became one of only 11 artists to have simultaneously held the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, with their singles \"Boom Boom Pow\" and \"I Gotta Feeling\", which topped the chart for an unprecedented 26 consecutive weeks. This album The E.N.D later produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with \"Imma Be\", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album, before being followed with \"Rock That Body\" and \"Meet Me Halfway\", which peaked in the Top 10 of the Hot 100. \"I Gotta Feeling\" became the first single to sell more than one million downloads in the United Kingdom.\nThe Black Eyed Peas were ranked 12th on Billboard's Decade-End Chart Artist of the Decade, and 7th in the Hot 100 Artists of the Decade. At the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, held in January 2010, they won three awards out of six nominations. In November 2010, they released the album The Beginning. In February 2011, the group performed at the Super Bowl XLV halftime show. The album's first two singles, \"The Time (Dirty Bit)\" and \"Just Can't Get Enough\", became international hits and topped the charts in many countries. The single \"Don't Stop the Party\" became an international hit as well.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Bon Iver is an American folk band founded in 2007 by indie folk singer-songwriter Justin Vernon. In addition to Vernon the band includes Michael Noyce, Sean Carey and Matthew McCaughan. Vernon released Bon Iver's debut album, For Emma, Forever Ago independently in July 2007. The majority of that album was recorded while Vernon spent three months in a remote cabin in northwestern Wisconsin. Bon Iver won the 2012 Grammy Award for Best New Artist and Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album for their self-titled album. The name Bon Iver is derived from the French phrase bon hiver (French pronunciation: ), meaning \"good winter\" or \"have a good winter\".\n\nJustin Vernon is joined live by Sean Carey (drums, vocals, piano), Michael Noyce (vocals, baritone guitar, guitar) and Matthew McCaughan (bass, drums, vocals). Noyce was Vernon's guitar student during high school.\n\nCarey approached Vernon during one of the first Bon Iver shows, telling him he could play and sing all the songs. Thereafter, the two played a number of them together. McCaughan and Vernon met while on tour with indie-rock band The Rosebuds in May 2007.\n\nBecause of the extensive use of vocal harmony on the songs of For Emma, Forever Ago, Vernon was concerned that there would not be enough voices to duplicate the sound of the songs on the album in a live setting. To compensate for this problem in early performances, Vernon passed out lyrics for some songs to the audience to sing along to. In an interview with Pitchfork, Vernon described this dilemma. \"I don't want to be the guy with an acoustic guitar singing songs, because that's boring for the most part. The song actually needs 80-500 people singing or whatever the vibe is of that room, it needs that fight\".\n\nBon Iver performed at Lollapalooza 2009. Bon Iver has also performed at Austin City Limits Music Festival, Bonnaroo, Glastonbury, Coachella, Ã˜yafestivalen, Way Out West and Sasquatch!, among others.\n\nAfter the release of Bon Iver's sophomore album, the live performances underwent a great deal of change. With older performances consisting of Vernon playing guitar, while Noyce, Carey, and McCaughan varied instruments, the concerts following Bon Iver, Bon Iver involved a much larger, full band. The new lineup consisted of the original four musicians, and included Rob Moose on violin and guitar (Antony and the Johnsons, The National), Mike Lewis on bass (Andrew Bird, Happy Apple), and a horn section including Reginald Pace, Colin Stetson (Tom Waits, Arcade Fire) and C.J. Camerieri (Rufus Wainwright, Sufjan Stevens) as well. On 2 February 2012 Sasquatch! announced Bon Iver as a headliner for their 2012 festival.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Breaking Benjamin is an American rock band from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, currently consisting of Benjamin Burnley and Chad Szeliga. The band has released four studio albums to date and a greatest hits album that was released on August 16, 2011. The group initially went on indefinite hiatus due to frontman Benjamin Burnley's recurring illnesses and inability to tour in mid-2010. Further complications arose in August 2011, when it was revealed that members Mark Klepaski and Aaron Fink had been fired from the band.\nBreaking Benjamin has sold over five million albums in the US alone.\nIn 1998, Burnley, guitarist Aaron Fink, Nick Hoover and Chris Lightcap formed Breaking Benjamin. Burnley later moved to California to experiment musically. When he moved back to Pennsylvania, he started a band called \"Plan 9\", playing guitar and singing alongside drummer Jeremy Hummel and bassist, Andy Seal, which was subsequently replaced by Jason Davoli in 2000, and Jonathan \"Bug\" Price in 2001. Plan 9 occasionally opened for Lifer at home shows. During one show, Burnley said, “Thank you, we’re Breaking Benjamin”, reclaiming the name from earlier in 1998. After a successful independently-released self-titled EP (which sold all 2,000 printed copies), Breaking Benjamin signed with Hollywood Records in early 2002. They then released their full-length major-label debut, Saturate, on August 27, 2002. It peaked at #2 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Chart, and at #136 on the Billboard Top 200.\nIts first single, \"Polyamorous\", received moderate radio play but failed to reach mainstream audiences. Three versions of a video for \"Polyamorous\" were released: one purely live-action footage, one with footage of the video game Run Like Hell and one a variation of the second, but with the Run Like Hell scenes replaced by scenes of people in flirtatious acts. This song was featured on the game WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw and also featured on WWE Day of Reckoning.\nThe second single was \"Skin\", which fared worse than \"Polyamorous\". Burnley has stated his disdain for the song during performances, and encourages the crowd to sing while the band plays. The disdain is because Hollywood Records chose it as the main single instead of the band's choice, \"Medicate\".\nThey planned on releasing a studio version of their cover of \"Enjoy the Silence\" (along with \"Lady Bug\") on the European version of Saturate, but this version was never released. \"Lady Bug\" was later released on the So Cold EP, and on the Japanese version of We Are Not Alone.\n\"Wish I May\" is played during the closing credits of the 2003 horror film, Wrong Turn.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Some life-changing moments are only apparent in retrospect. Brett Eldredge recognized his as it was happening.  The Paris, IL, native was visiting Nashville for the first time early in his sophomore year at Chicago's Elmhurst College. He was at the Station Inn, an historic bluegrass/country venue where many of the greats of both worlds have played. His cousin Terry, a veteran of Dolly Parton's band and now a member of the Grascals, was playing with a band called the Sidemen, and a mesmerized Brett was in the crowd.  \"There was something so real and truthful about the songs they were playing,\" he says. \"What happened next came as a shock.\"  \"He asked me to come up on stage and told me to pick a song to play with the band,\" says Brett. I said, 'Amarillo By Morning,' and when I heard that fiddle intro, chills shot up my spine. I sang it for the crowd there and it was a magical experience. That was the point where I thought, 'This is it. This is something I've got to do.'\"  By the start of the next school year, he had transferred to Middle Tennessee State University and begun the round of writers' nights and writing appointments that led him eventually to a record deal. The talent that let him turn that dream into reality--the depth of his writing and the sheer power of his smoky and expressive baritone--are both apparent in his first single. \"Raymond\" is the poignant tale of a nursing home employee mistaken by a patient with Alzheimer's for her deceased son, who was killed at war. It is a song whose inspiring reaffirmation of their mutual humanity is affecting listeners deeply. The single rings true for Eldredge as his Grandmother currently struggles through the disease. \"There are a lot of things I'll play live where people will say, 'I like that,' or 'That's a really cool song,'\" Brett says, \"but when I do this one, I get the chance to tell people how special a thing it's been in my life, and it always touches someone. A lot of people know someone with Alzheimer's and people react in a really emotional way to it.\" Brett has earned a reputation as much for the strength of his writing as for his world-class voice. He and co-writer Pat McLaughlin landed a song called \"I Think I've Had Enough\" on Gary Allan's latest album, Get Off On The Pain, and one of his frequent collaborators is Country Music Hall of Famer and Grand Ole Opry stalwart Bill Anderson. \"He's one of my favorite people to write with,\" says Brett. \"I love the fact that he believes in country music so much, because it's something I really believe in. My dream, as I find my place in country music, is one day to be an Opry member.\" Brett heard all kinds of music growing up, and became a particular fan of the classic pop singers he heard in his grandfather's car. \"I heard a lot of Frank Sinatra, who is still a favorite of mine, and Ray Charles and Bobby Darin,\" he says. \"When my mother convinced me to sing 'Mack The Knife' at a talent show, I got hooked on singing in public.\" That was in Paris, a town of 9,000 with \"cornfields and factories and lake right in the middle.\" Brett, his older brother and his parents--a traveling grain salesman and a nurse--lived on the lake and, says Brett, \"We were on the water every day, from the time I was so little they could pull me on water skis in a paddle boat until I left for college at 18.\" Sports were a big part of his life, and he played basketball, baseball and football in high school. He also sang everywhere he could, often the Big Band music of Sinatra, earning spending money and learning to work a stage. His appreciation for country music became a passion when he turned 16 and he and a friend rode around listening to a Brooks & Dunn greatest hits album. \"There was something about it that just struck me,\" he says. \"I couldn't get enough of it. Ronnie Dunn is one of my favorite singers of all time--I love the soul in his voice--and one of the main reasons I got into this in the first place.\" Brett spent two years in Chicago, where his older brother lived, performing with a school jazz band and with a Big Band around the region. \"One of the coolest gigs,\" he says, \"was at the Field Museum, I was singing in front of a 12-piece band under this huge Tyrannosaurus Rex statue near some mammoths. It was quite the experience.\" Then came that fateful visit to Nashville and his transfer to MTSU. He studied classic country stylists like Ray Price and George Jones, and later Vince Gill, absorbing everything he could. \"I was driving back and forth Nashville every day from Murfreesboro, which is thirty miles away,\" he says. \"I had a guitar Terry had given me, which was originally a gift from Dolly, and I'd pretty much lock myself in my room and make myself learn songs. I would play writers' nights all around Nashville. There might be two people, there might be 40 or 50. I'd go play my songs and see what people liked and what they didn't. I'd screw up royally in front of them, but I learned.\" He earned a degree, which, he says, \"made Mom and Dad happy, and then I moved on to what I really wanted to do. A staff writer for hit producer/publisher Byron Gallimore heard him at a writers' night and introduced him to Byron, who signed him. \"I wrote for about two years, developing my craft and writing with everyone I could. In the beginning, Byron just let me kind of find myself, because that takes a while. As you write more you starting homing in on what you sound good on. Eventually, Byron said, 'You've got something here' and we went in and started cutting songs. We did a showcase, and Carole Ann Mobley from Warner Music Nashville said, 'We've gotta sign this kid'. Mobley and Craig Kallman then signed Brett to Atlantic Records, making him the first official signing for the new imprint. As he worked with his band tightening his show, he was offered a particularly gratifying gig. \"I opened for Blake Shelton at The Ryman and it was the coolest experience. I flew back from this house gig and all of a sudden I'm thrown into playing the Mother Church of Country Music, something I always dreamed of doing. I was operating on almost no sleep, but stepping out on that stage where everybody who's anybody in country music has been meant the world to me.\" He remains active in sports, playing basketball and volleyball and playing on an intramural softball team in Nashville, and rooting for the Cubs and Bears. Meanwhile, he is dedicated to improving his craft. \"As a songwriter,\" he says, \"my aim is to portray a little bit of me and my life along with the stories of other people and turn them into something that can really touch somebody's heart and soul. We sit down on Music Row every day and write songs and every once in a while a song like 'Raymond' comes from such a real place. I hope it's that real to other people and that I can make them feel the way I felt when I wrote it and when I sing it.\" Judging from audience reaction, that's exactly what he's doing.",

He was a college baseball pitcher but took up songwriting after getting injured. His self-titled debut EP, produced by Dann Huff, was released by Republic Nashville on February 12, 2016. The lead single, \"Sleep Without You\", was released on April 11.\n\nYoung was born in Anaheim, Orange County. He attended Calvary Chapel High School in Costa Mesa, California, and then Ole Miss, Irvine Valley College, and Fresno State University. He started singing in the late 1990s when he stepped in to replace an absent leader of the band during a Christian worship meeting at high school.\n\nYoung was a pitcher on his high school baseball team and led the squad to a CIF championship. He went to Ole Miss on a baseball scholarship in 1999 after turning down pre-draft selection by both Tampa Devil Rays and Minnesota Twins. In his one-season on the Rebel baseball team in 2000, he earned a varsity letter and posted two wins and two saves. He lettered for one season at Irvine Valley before moving to Fresno. However, his pursuit of a professional baseball career was cut short by an elbow injury while at Fresno in 2003.\n\nAccording to Young, he was inspired by Gavin DeGraw after he heard his album Chariot and decided to return to music. Young independently released a self-titled 4-song EP in 2007, then Make Believe in 2011, followed by the albums Brett Young, On fire, and Broken Down in 2012-13.\n\nAfter eight years based in Los Angeles, Young moved to Nashville. He was soon signed by the Big Machine Label Group in August 2015.",

The band is composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Jason James (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Michael Thomas (drums). They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. Financial difficulties dictated the name change, which was followed by a change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic heavy metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden, and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.\n\nBullet for My Valentine's debut album, The Poison, was released on 3 October 2005 in the United Kingdom and on 14 February 2006 in the United States to coincide with Valentine's Day hence their band name. The album entered the Billboard 200 in the US at number 128. It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The band made appearances at the Download Festival and Kerrang! XXV, and undertook a US tour with Rob Zombie. Bullet for My Valentine's second studio album, Scream Aim Fire, was released on 29 January 2008 and debuted at number four on the Billboard 200.

He got involved in music in the early 1980s, making his debut in a high school band called Apocalipsis, and later played along with Proceso Entrópico. In 1984, Bunbury joined a group called Zumo de Vidrio, debuting as a lead vocalist. After adopting the nickname of Bunbury, taken from the Oscar Wilde stage play The Importance of Being Earnest, the musician teamed up with Héroes del Silencio, becoming a major number in the Hispanic rock scene. The band eventually broke up in 1996 and Bunbury started his solo career in 1997 with a electro-rock album, Radical Sonora with his new band: Copi (piano), Del Moran (bass), Ramon Gacias (drums) and former Héroes del Silencio guitarist Alan Boguslavsky.\nRecognized by his wish to always reinvent himself, Bunbury released in 1999 the album Pequeño, which sounded very different from anything he did before. His band also suffered changes, Boguslavsky was replaced by Rafa Dominguez, and the new faces, Ana Belén Estaje (violin), Luis Miguel Romero (percussion), Javier Iñigo, Javier Garcia Vega & Antonio Ríos in the metal instruments.\nThis band was known as the \"Huracán Ambulante\" (\"Wandering Hurricane\") and recorded with Bunbury the rest of his solo discography.\nIn 2005, after 8 years together, Bunbury dissolved the band and recorded a new album in 2006 with Nacho Vegas.\nIn 2007, Héroes del Silencio agreed to participate in a 10 concert exclusive worldwide tour in ten cities around the world, simply called \"Tour 2007\" to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their first performances and it has also been 10 years since their disbanding in 1996.

This group emerged from Univisión’s musical competition, La Banda, which is executive-produced by Simon Cowell’s SYCO Entertainment, the global icon Ricky Martin, Univisión Communications Inc., and Haim Saban’s Saban Brands. It is co-produced by FremantleMedia Latin America.\n\nAt the conclusion of this 13-week program, five contestants were able to achieve their goal of joining CNCO – Christopher Vélez, Erick Brian Colón, Joel Pimentel, Richard Camacho and Zabdiel de Jesús. They won over millions of viewers, along with the renowned judges of La Banda: Ricky Martin, Laura Pausini and Alejandro Sanz. Winning a spot on this band comes with the reward of a recording contract with Sony Music Latin, and a management deal with an all-pro team led by Ricky Martin.\n\nComprising five young men, this group is really to show its talent to the world and launch a long-lasting career. Just one day after being announced as the winners on La Banda, CNCO accomplished the milestone of its first public performance, singing at New York City’s Times Square as part of Univisión’s ¡Feliz 2016! program to ring in the new year.\n\nThey’re now immersed in the recording studio where they’re preparing their first album, which is being produced by the urban-music legend Wisin. The group’s first single, “Tan Fácil” (So Easy), debuted in late January. Just hours after its release, it reached #1 on the iTunes Latin singles chart.\n\nOn January 30, CNCO gave its first full concert at The Fillmore Miami Beach at Jackie Gleason Theater.\n\nEven bigger stages awaited the group in February and March, as CNCO joined the legendary Ricky Martin’s One World Tour, opening for him on his Puerto Rico, Argentina and Chile performances. Afterwards, the group traveled to Ecuador for a promotional tour that allowed the members to meet their quickly growing legions of fans, known as CNCOwners, in the Andean nation.\n\nThe group also visited major media outlets, giving interviews with the national and international press.\n\nAbout the members of CNCO:\n\nChristopher: This 20-year-old Ecuadorean moved to New Jersey in search of a better life for his family. He shined shoes for a time, and hopes his mother will be able to join him soon.\n\nErick Brian: He arrived in the U.S. with his mother and sister from Cuba three years ago. He loves to play football, dance, and participate in musical activities at his school in Tampa. He is 15 years old.\n\nJoel: The biggest inspiration for this 16-year-old Californian of Mexican ancestry has been his late grandfather, who gave him the strength to continue singing and to study theater.\n\nZabdiel: This 18-year-old Puerto Rican was part of a hip-hop and salsa group in his church. He has been a musician, singer, and ballet dancer.\n\nRichard: He grew up in the entertainment world, with a musician and cameraman father, and a dancer for a mother. This 19-year-old Dominican likes to dance and write songs, and to share his love of music with his twin brother.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Calibre, birth name Dominick Martin, is a Drum and Bass, and Liquid Funk, music producer and DJ hailing from Belfast, Northern Ireland. He originally started producing at a young age and has spent many years refining his sound. He is a classically trained musician playing a variety of musical instruments eventually becoming a self-taught music producer. Martin started producing Drum and Bass in 1995 and his first signed release was credited under the now defunct Quadrophonic label owned by U2.\nIn addition to impressing some of the biggest names in the business, he soon came to the attention of drum and bass DJ Fabio, who signed Calibre to his influential Creative Source label. While studying Fine Arts at the University of Ulster in Belfast, he became interested in the music of John Cage whose work was influential in entitling Martin’s first album release Musique Concrète in 2001. Since his initial releases in 2001, Martin has been known for his consistent signature style and sound, which is highly sought after for remixes, by both major labels and independent recording artists.\nAlthough Calibre is quite successful within the drum and bass circuit, he is a notably quiet man. Short Circuits Magazine refers to him as \"one of the quietest people in drum and bass\". He only shares tracks with a small circle of friends. On top of this Dominick had no website or even any blog presence to showcase his tracks online. Most news about his work came from BBC Radio 1, 1Xtra, Marcus Intalex (his labelmate) or other DJs associated with him.",

His gold-selling debut album, I Created Disco, was released in 2007 and contained the top ten singles \"Acceptable in the 80s\" and \"The Girls\". His second studio album, Ready for the Weekend (2009), reached number one in the UK Album Chart and includes the chart-topper \"I'm Not Alone\", the UK top five hit \"Ready for the Weekend\", and the singles \"Flashback\" and \"You Used to Hold Me\".\nA remix album titled L.E.D. Festival was released in July 2010 as a free album in the August issue of Mixmag. Harris is currently working on his third studio album due for release in October 2012 which has produced the singles \"Awooga\", \"Bounce\", \"Feel So Close\", and \"Let's Go\". He has written and produced records for other recording artists including Kylie Minogue, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Dizzee Rascal, Rihanna (on the international chart topper \"We Found Love\"), and Kesha.\nHarris was born in Dumfries, Scotland. He states that his childhood hero was football star Steve McManaman, but because he could not play  nor have McManaman's 'curly hair', music was the next best option for a career. He was first attracted to electronic music in his teens and was recording bedroom demos by 1999. According to an interview with News of the World, all the while he created music, he started becoming an antisocial person, which affected his personality. His earliest success was when he was 21: the songs \"Da Bongos\" and \"Brighter Days\" were released as a 12\" club single and CD-EP by the Prima Facie label in early 2002 under the name Stouffer. He released one song in 2004, \"Let Me Know\", with artist Ayah Marar. The song appears on The Unabombers' Electric Soul 2.",

Desde los once años sintió gran atracción hacia la música, y con ninguna experiencia al respecto, comienza practicar la \"improvisación\" en ritmos de Reggaeton muy populares entonces y el Hip Hop, haciéndose llamar ya como \"Canserbero\". Tres años más tarde recibe la noticia de la muerte de su hermano mayor por parte de padre (victima de la violencia), los siguientes años Canserbero comienza a inclinarse hacia corrientes más oscuras en la música como el Hard Rock y el Hip Hop de los 90. Ese mismo año Canserbero conoce a Manuel Galvis ( Blackamikace) y al ya beatmaker y productor Leonardo Díaz (Afromack) los cuales vivían cerca de su residencia ubicada en un vecindario llamado Animas 1 de La Pica en Palo Negro, Canserbero y Blackamikace deciden formar una agrupación de Hip Hop y debido a su poca experiencia acuden a la ayuda de Afromack, conformando así un proyecto titulado \"Códigos de Barrio\" en el que aunque se compusieron múltiples temas, solo se grabaron unos tres o cuatro de ellos, motivado también a la escasez de recursos y a la corta edad de ambos. Era ya 2003 cuando \"Códigos de Barrio\" se foguea en el creciente movimiento regional de Hip-Hop cuyas influencias eran motivadas por bandas locales establecidas como Comando 57 (Sombra & Dj Afromack) y Supremacy Hip Hop Clan (Lil Supa y Daniggaz).

Después de cuatro años aprendiendo con Basyco a través de las múltiples presentaciones y temas grabados en el techo que a su vez se distribuían por medio del Internet, Canserbero y Lil Supa deciden producir un disco juntos llamado \"Índigos, Can+Zoo\" el cual aportó un impacto importante en la movida nacional y latinoamericana del Rap no comercial, demostrando el buen momento que ambos artistas atravesaban realizaron una gira nacional que a pesar de los pocos recursos fue recibida con ansias por los escuchas de este género, el disco \"Índigos, Can+Zoo\" se agotó en muy poco tiempo. El año siguiente Canserbero decide compilar los temas previamente distribuidos por Internet además de un sencillo principal, elaborando así un \"mixtape\" el cual tituló \"Nuestra Doctrina No es un Dogma, es una Guía Para la Acción\" cuya distribución fue gratuita y exclusivamente vía Internet. Actualmente Canserbero Terminó su último titulado \"VIDA\"producìdo en su totalidad por KPU (Leandro Anez) Realizado de manera independiente grabado y editado en Caracas Venezuela por KPU Y CANSERBERO. en \"LA BIBLIOTECA\" Publicado en la Internet el 20-06-2010",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Chancelor Bennett (born April 16, 1993), better known by his stage name Chance The Rapper, is an American hip hop recording artist from the Chatham neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. In 2013, he began to gain major recognition following the release of his second mixtape Acid Rap.\nChance started showing interest in music at a young age, and in his freshman year of high school at Chicago's Jones College Prep High School, formed the hip-hop duo Instrumentality with a friend. He mentioned in an interview that fellow Chicago native Kanye West's 2004 debut album The College Dropout was the first hip-hop album that he ever purchased and listened to, previously being into soul and jazz.\nAt Jones College Prep High School, some of his teachers ridiculed his aspirations to become a musician. Following a 10-day suspension in early 2011 during his senior year \"for weed related activities\", Bennett recorded his first full-length project, a mixtape titled 10 Day. In December 2011, he released a song titled \"Windows\", and publicly announced his 10 Day project. After the song's release, in February 2012, Bennett was highlighted as one of Complex magazine's \"10 New Chicago Rappers to Watch Out For.\" Bennett says he spent about eight months recording, writing and making connections off of the hunger to put out something. After about a year’s time of working on the tape, Bennett released it on April 3, 2012 and it has since been downloaded over 250,000 times via Datpiff. The mixtape was well received locally and would help Bennett make connections with producers such as Chuck Inglish , Kenny Jame$ and Blended Babies. The mixtape would also grab the attention of Forbes magazine, which featured it in the publication's Cheap Tunes column.\n\nIn July 2012, Bennett appeared on American rapper Childish Gambino's sixth mixtape Royalty, on the track \"They Don't Like Me\". Gambino would then ask Bennett to join his 2012 concert tour of North America, as his opening act.\nChance released his second mixtape Acid Rap, on April 30, 2013. On DatPiff it has been certified double platinum after being downloaded over 800,000 times. The mixtape features guest appearances from Twista, Vic Mensa, BJ the Chicago Kid, Action Bronson, Childish Gambino and Ab-Soul. Acid Rap was strongly praised by music critics and fans alike. At Metacritic, the mixtape received an average score of 86, based on 21 critics, which indicates \"universal acclaim.\" It was also nominated for Best Mixtape at the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards.\n\nOn May 6, 2013, after previously being featured as the hidden track on Acid Rap, a song titled \"Paranoia\", produced by Nosaj Thing, was released as a contribution to Yours Truly and Adidas originals \"Songs from Scratch\" series. In June 2013, Bennett was featured in a commercial for MySpace as part of their relaunch, alongside fellow American rappers Mac Miller, Pharrell and Schoolboy Q, among others. In early July 2013, Acid Rap debuted at number 63 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums due to bootleg downloads on iTunes and Amazon. In August 2013, Bennett performed at the Chicago music festival Lollapalooza.\n\nAcid Rap was listed on multiple 50 best albums of 2013 lists, including 26th for Rolling Stone, 12th on Pitchfork's list, and ranked 4th by Complex. It was also listed as one of NPR Music's 50 Favorite Albums Of 2013.\n\nChance embarked on his Social Experiment Tour, in Champaign, Illinois on October 25, 2013, lasting until December 19, 2013. He was also a featured artist on a track on Childish Gambino's album Because the Internet, which was released on December 6, 2013.\n\nIn March 2014, Bennett appeared in a shoppable online video for Dockers, promoting the brand's spring line, in which Bennett talks his style, love for creating music, and how it feels to live in Los Angeles. On May 5, 2014, XXL revealed Bennett was included in their annual freshman class, alongside fellow up-and-comers Isaiah Rashad, Ty Dolla $ign, Rich Homie Quan, Vic Mensa, August Alsina, Troy Ave, Kevin Gates, Lil Bibby, Jon Connor, Lil Durk and Jarren Benton. During Fall 2014, Bennett and other artists participated in Verge Campus tour. In November 2014, Bennett was presented Chicago's \"Outstanding Youth of the Year Award\" by Mayor Rahm Emanuel.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Em 1987, o então adolescente paulistano de apenas dezessete anos de idade Alexandre Magno se mudou para Santos, litoral de São Paulo, após uma infância difícil e traumática. Era mais conhecido pelo apelido de Chorão, passou a se interessar pela prática do skate. Um dia, em um bar local, substituiu por acaso o vocalista de uma banda, quando o mesmo precisou se ausentar devido a necessidades fisiológicas. Uma pessoa da plateia, ao vê-lo cantar, convidou-o para ser vocalista em sua banda. Quando o baixista da referida banda saiu, Chorão veio a conhecer Champignon, o novo baixista, uma criança de apenas doze anos na época, formaram então a banda What's Up. Tempos depois, Chorão e Champignon decidiram convidar o baterista Renato Pelado, egresso de bandas da cidade como Ecossistema, Jornal do Brasil, entre outros projetos. Mais tarde, Marcão e Thiago Castanho completaram a primeira formação da banda Charlie Brown Jr. A banda, ainda sem nome, continuou a se apresentar na cidade. \"Fundei e batizei a banda com esse nome em 1992. Foi uma coisa inusitada. Trombei (literalmente) com uma barraca de água de coco que tinha o desenho do Charlie Brown, aquele personagem do Charles Schulz, mais conhecido por ser o dono do Snoopy. E o \"Jr\" é pelo fato de sermos filhos do rock\", se explica Chorão pelo fato de a banda se considerar \"filha\" de uma geração de músicos e bandas como Raimundos, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nação Zumbi, e Planet Hemp. A sonoridade do grupo tinha influências de grupos como Sublime, Bad Brains, 311, misturando hardcore, skate e reggae O vocalista da banda, Chorão, era skatista, chegando a figurar nas melhores posições do ranking de diversos campeonatos brasileiros, e costumava apresentar-se nos shows em cima de um skate. Por volta de 1993, já com esta formação da banda, eles começaram a tocar no circuito underground de Santos e São Paulo e a fazer shows em vários eventos de skate. As primeiras apresentações do quinteto aconteceram em Santos e São Paulo, especialmente em campeonatos de skate.\nUma fita demo foi entregue a Rick Bonadio, presidente da Virgin Records no Brasil e produtor dos Mamonas Assassinas, que se interessou pelo grupo e os contratou. De uma demo de três faixas surge o primeiro disco do CBJr, produzido por Tadeu Patolla e Rick Bonadio com o selo da Virgin. Nasce então o álbum Transpiração Contínua Prolongada, tem esse nome por realmente retratar tudo que a galera passou para chegar onde chegaram. O álbum foi produzido por Tadeu Patola (ex-Lagoa 66), o álbum é bem recebido pelas rádios com as faixas \"O Coro Vai Comê!\", \"Proibida pra Mim (Grazon)\", \"Tudo que Ela Gosta de Escutar\" e \"Gimme o Anel\", vendendo 500 mil cópias. Na época, o baixista Champignon era menor. Consequentemente, sempre que a banda se apresentava em casas noturnas, era necessária uma autorização judicial para que o jovem baixista acompanhasse o grupo.",

Three songs from the album were subsequently voted into the top ten of Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2014, including the number one spot for \"Talk Is Cheap\".\n\nMurphy decided to play under a stage name after people came to his shows thinking he was a different and already established musician named Nick Murphy. He settled on the name Chet Faker as an homage to Chet Baker: \"I listened to a lot of jazz and I was a big fan of ... the way he sang, when he moved into mainstream singing. He had this really fragile vocal style—this really, broken, close-up and intimate style. The name is kind of just an ode to Chet Baker and the mood of music he used to play—something I would like to at least pay homage to in my own music.\" Other influences he has cited include Bob Dylan, as well as his mother's Motown albums and his father's \"chilled out Ibiza CDs\".\n\nHe first rose to prominence after his cover of Blackstreet's \"No Diggity\" went viral online, reaching number 1 on the Hypemachine chart in May 2011. He released his first EP, Thinking in Textures, on 22 March 2012 to positive reviews, being described as \"wonderfully loungey\" and praised for its ability to \"mix subtlety with impressive beauty\". The EP was also popular with fans, with its second single, \"I'm Into You\", landing at number 24 on radio station Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2012.\n\nFaker has worked with several other artists since the release of his debut EP, including collaborations with Flume and remixes of songs by MS MR and The Temper Trap. He was a featured vocalist on Say Lou Lou's \"Fool of Me\", which was named Best New Track by Pitchfork in May 2013.\nOn 12 August 2013, Faker released a new single, \"Melt\", featuring American vocalist Kilo Kish. In November 2013, Flume and Faker released an EP, titled Lockjaw. Faker's debut album, Built on Glass, was released on 11 April 2014, preceded by the release of its lead single, \"Talk Is Cheap\", and its accompanying music video on 11 February. The album debuted at number 1 on the ARIA Charts.\n\nIn January 2015, it was announced that Faker would perform at the Boston Calling Music Festival in May 2015. Later that month, \"Talk Is Cheap\" was named the number one song in the 2014 Triple J Hottest 100 countdown, while two of his other singles, \"Gold\" and \"1998\", also reached the top ten, placing at number 7 and 8 respectively. In June, Faker released a new single titled \"Bend\", a previously unreleased track intended for Built on Glass. It was promoted by his Australian Built on Live tour in October.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Keith Cozart (born August 15, 1995), better known by his stage name Chief Keef, is an American rapper from Chicago, Illinois. He has signed a major record deal with Interscope Records, along with 1017 Brick Squad, and was the CEO of his own record label Glory Boyz Entertainment. His debut album Finally Rich was released on December 18, 2012.\nKeith Cozart was born in Chicago, Illinois and grew up in the Englewood neighborhood on the city's South Side. He attended Dulles Elementary School and the Banner School, a therapeutic day school. Cozart dropped out of high school at age 15. He began rapping at a very young age, regularly listed as 5, using his mother's karaoke machine and blank tapes to record his music.\nWhile under house arrest for a previous weapons charge, Cozart posted several videos to his YouTube account. The attention he received increased during the short time between the release of several mixtapes and music videos, including \"Bang\", \"3Hunna\" and \"I Don't Like\". After two locally successful mixtapes, \"I Don't Like\" became a local hit in Chicago. It also caught fellow Chicago rapper Kanye West's attention, and West created a remix of the song with rappers Pusha T, Jadakiss and Big Sean.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, Keef was in the middle of a bidding war with many labels to sign him including Young Jeezy's CTE World. He would end up signing with Interscope Records due to them giving him his own label to run in Glory Boyz Entertainment. The deal is worth six million dollars over a three album deal. According to the deal Interscope has the right to pull out of the contract if he doesn't sell 250,000 copies of his debut LP by December 2013. Chief Keef's debut studio album Finally Rich, was released on December 18, 2012. Featured guests on the album included rappers 50 Cent, Wiz Khalifa, Young Jeezy, Rick Ross and his fellow Glory Boyz member Lil Reese.\n\nOn March 26, 2013, it was announced that Keef would be a part of XXL Magazine's 2013 Freshman Class. On May 8, 2013, Gucci Mane announced via Twitter that Chief Keef was the newest member of 1017 Brick Squad Records. On his 18th birthday, August 15, 2013, Chief Keef celebrated by releasing the mixtape Bang Part 2. Bang Part 2 was highly anticipated as the first project following his debut album, but ended up disappointing quite a few and received mixed critical responses. On October 12, 2013, he released Almighty Sosa another mixtape, however leading up to release he did not do much promotion for it. Following his October 2013 jail term, he began working on his second studio album and a biopic.",

The Philadelphia native had moved to Los Angeles several years prior, hoping to spin her musical abilities into a record deal. Her brother, Nick Perri, had found platinum-certified success as the guitarist of Shinedown, but Christina’s own efforts weren’t met with such luck. She married, divorced, and took up a job at the Melrose Café in Beverly Hills, with music taking a backseat role as she struggled to pay the bills. While recording an EP, though, she managed to contact a choreographer from the TV show So You Think You Can Dance. Weeks later, one of Perri’s piano ballads, “Jar of Hearts,” was used in an episode of the show, and public demand for the single convinced her to release \"Jar of Hearts\" independently. Over 100,000 people downloaded the song during its first two weeks, helping it crack the Billboard Top 40, and Perri inked a record contract with Atlantic before the summer was up. The following February, \"Jar of Hearts\" climbed to platinum status as Perri put the finishing touches on her debut album, lovestrong., and prepared for a spring tour with James Blunt. 2012 saw the release of Perri's first-ever holiday album, Very Merry Perri Christmas.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Craig Ashley David (born 5 May 1981) is an English singer-songwriter who rose to fame in 1999 featuring on the single \"Re-Rewind\" by Artful Dodger. David's debut album, Born to Do It, was released on 14 August 2000, after which he has since released five further studio albums and worked with a variety of artists such as Tinchy Stryder, Kano, Jay Sean, Rita Ora and Sting.\nDavid has been nominated for twelve Brit Awards—three times for Best British Male, and twice received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.David was born in Southampton, Hampshire, the son of Tina (née Loftus), a retail assistant at Superdrug, and George David, a carpenter, and grew up in the Holyrood estate. David's father is Grenadian and David's mother is English and related to the founders of the Accurist watch-making company; David's maternal grandfather was an Orthodox Jew and his maternal grandmother a convert to Judaism. David's parents separated when he was eight and he was raised by his mother. He attended Bellemoor School and Southampton City College.\nDavid's father played bass in a reggae band called Ebony Rockers. As a teen, David began accompanying his father to local dance clubs, where DJs let him take the microphone. David's earliest exposure came when he worked on a b-side to British group Damage's cover of \"Wonderful Tonight\". He then started doing vocals for a few tracks with garage act Artful Dodger.\nWildstar Records first became aware of Craig David when the artist's then manager Paul Widger met the label's co-owner Colin Lester and played some of his music. Lester later told HitQuarters that he was particularly impressed by the first song he heard, \"Walking Away\", saying \"That was an absolute stand out ... It struck me that any seventeen year-old that could write a song like this had huge potential.\" The Wildstar boss was further won over when, on later visiting the artist's home in Southampton, he found that David's tiny bedroom stacked from floor to ceiling with 12\" vinyl records, commenting: \"That convinced me he was the real deal and not just some kid acting out the part.\" At that point Lester offered him a development deal with his label. When Lester later heard the song \"7 Days\", he said he immediately heard a #1 record and promoted the contract to an album deal the same day.\nThe song \"Re-Rewind\", from the Artful Dodger album It's All About the Stragglers, hit Number 2 on the UK charts in 1999; thus, paving the way for a solo career. David's first single, \"Fill Me In\", released on Colin Lester's and Ian McAndrew's Wildstar Records, made him the youngest solo male artist ever to reach Number 1 in the United Kingdom (he was 18 years old at the time). This was the first of a string of four Top 10 singles from his debut album Born To Do It, which eventually sold more than seven million units worldwide, earning multi-platinum status in more than 20 countries. The song \"Key To My Heart\", taken from the US version of the album, was also featured on the award-winning Warner Brothers animated film Osmosis Jones.#",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Ramón Luis Ayala Rodríguez (born February 3, 1977), known by his stage name Daddy Yankee, is a Puerto Rican singer, songwriter, rapper, actor, and record producer. Ayala was born in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, and was raised in the neighborhood of Villa Kennedy Housing Projects. Daddy Yankee is the artist who coined the word Reggaeton in 1994 to describe the new music genre that was emerging from Puerto Rico. According to the New York Times, he is known as the \"King of Reggaetón\" by music critics and fans alike.\n\nAyala aspired to be a professional baseball player, and tried out for the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball. Before he could be officially signed, he was hit by a stray round from an AK-47 rifle while taking a break from a studio recording session with reggaeton mix tape icon DJ Playero. Ayala spent roughly one and a half years recovering from the wound; the bullet was never removed from his hip, and he credits the shooting incident with allowing him to focus entirely on a music career. In 2004, Daddy Yankee released his internationally acclaimed single \"Gasolina\", which is credited with introducing reggaeton to audiences worldwide, and making the music genre a global phenomenon. Since then, he has sold around 20 million records. Daddy Yankee's album Barrio Fino made history when it became the top-selling Latin music album of the decade between 2000–2009. In 2017, Daddy Yankee, in collaboration with Latin pop singer Luis Fonsi, released the hit single \"Despacito\". It became the first Spanish-language song to hit number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 since \"Macarena\" in 1996. The single gained global success. The official video for \"Despacito\" on YouTube received its billionth view on April 20, 2017 after 97 days, becoming the second-fastest video on the site to reach the milestone behind Adele's \"Hello\". Its success led Daddy Yankee to become the most listened artist worldwide on the streaming service Spotify in June 2017, being the first Latin artist to do so.\n\nDaddy Yankee has received various awards and nominations throughout his career. As of 2017, he has won 82 awards from 270 nominations since his rise to international fame in 2004. He has won 5 Latin Grammy Award, 2 Billboard Music Awards, 14 Billboard Latin Music Awards, 2 Latin American Music Awards, 8 Lo Nuestro Awards, an MTV Video Music Award and 6 ASCAP Awards. He also received a Puerto Rican Walk of Fame Star, special awards by People en Español magazine, and the Presencia Latina at Harvard University. He was named by CNN as the \"Most Influential Hispanic Artist\" of 2009, and included in Time 100 in 2006.",

After independently building a following through the release of two critically acclaimed EPs, Praise Break (2014) and Pilgrim's Paradise (2015), Caesar released his debut album Freudian in August 2017, which garnered widespread critical acclaim.\nCaesar's music is influenced by soul and gospel. His music draws from his childhood experiences and integrates them with R&B and electronics, while his lyrics explore subjects of religion and unrequited love. His singing voice reshapes itself on each track, often veering into a hushed, introspective lilting style. According to Caesar, \"In my religious surroundings growing up, the point is to be still, to direct as little attention to yourself as possible and instead, direct all attention to what you’re saying. Now, it’s kind of the opposite.\" Caesar cites Frank Ocean, Kanye West, Beyoncé, and The Doors frontman Jim Morrison as musical and stylistic inspirations.\nCaesar works in close collaboration with producers Matthew Burnett and Jordan Evans, with whom he co-founded his independent label, Golden Child Recordings, and has co-produced almost all of his music with since 2015. Caesar is also part of an informal collaborative of Toronto-based musicians and songwriters that includes River Tiber, BadBadNotGood, and Charlotte Day Wilson, among others.",

Rucker co-wrote the majority of the band's songs with the other three members.\nHe released a solo R&B album, Back to Then, in 2002 on Hidden Beach Recordings but did not chart any singles from it. Six years later, Rucker signed to Capitol Records Nashville as a country music artist, releasing the album Learn to Live that year. Its first single, \"Don't Think I Don't Think About It\", made him the first African American to chart a number one on the Hot Country Songs charts since Charley Pride in 1983. It was followed by two more number-one singles, \"It Won't Be Like This for Long\" and \"Alright\" and the number three \"History in the Making\".

The band consists of Chino Moreno (lead vocals and guitar), Stephen Carpenter (guitar), Chi Cheng (bass), Frank Delgado (keyboards and turntables), and Abe Cunningham (drums and percussion). As of 2009, Sergio Vega is standing in on bass while Cheng recovers from a car accident. They have released six albums to date, with three Platinum (Adrenaline, White Pony, Around the Fur) and one Gold certification (for the self-titled album).\nWhen Carpenter was 15 years old, he was hit by a car while skateboarding. Confined to a wheelchair for several months, he began teaching himself guitar by playing along to bands such as Anthrax, Stormtroopers of Death, and Metallica. Supposedly, the driver paid Carpenter a cash settlement that allowed the band to purchase equipment, but Cunningham commented in an interview that was all just \"a myth about how our band was started.\" Carpenter, Moreno, and Cunningham were friends from their childhood. All three went to McClatchy High School in Sacramento and remained friends through the city's skateboarding scene. When Moreno found out Carpenter played guitar, he set up a jam session with Cunningham, who played drums, and the three began playing regularly in Carpenter's garage circa 1988. After playing with several bassists, the band acquired Chi Cheng and recorded a four track demo soon after. Within two years, the band began playing club shows and later expanded their playing territory to San Francisco and Los Angeles, where they played shows alongside bands such as Korn. While closing for another band in L.A., after the majority of the audience had left, the band impressed a Maverick Records representative.",

Clark, and Yung Simmie, among others. \n\nOn June 9, 2015, Curry released his first double EP, titled 32 Zel/Planet Shrooms. His first release in 2016 was the single \"Flying Nimbus\".\n\nHis second full-length album, titled Imperial, was released on March 9, 2016, then re-released later on Spotify as the deluxe version on October 14, 2016.\n\nIn June 2016, Curry was featured on a cover as one of the XXL's 2016's Freshmen Class.\n\nOn May 13, 2017, Curry uploaded a track entitled \"Hate Government \" to his SoundCloud account. In the weeks that followed, he released two more demos for songs entitled \"Equalizer \" and \"ZELTRON 6 BILLION ft. Lil Ugly Mane.\" After these releases as well as a series of cryptic posts on social media (seemingly portraying another alter ego called Zeltron), he released an EP entitled 13 on June 25, 2017. All of the demo tracks were included on the EP as well as two other new songs. On August 18, 2017, Curry released another song called \"Skywalker.\" Later that year, on September 22, a remastered version of 32 Zel was released, including a remix of \"Ultimate\" featuring Juicy J.\n\nOn April 2, 2018, Curry released the lead single off of Ta13oo titled, \"Sumo\" on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show. On May 24, 2018, Curry released the second single off the album titled, \"Percs\". Curry then released the third single titled, \"Clout Cobain\", on July 13, 2018, and announced that his album Ta13oo, would be released in three acts: The first act, Light, was released on July 25, followed by Gray on July 26, and Dark on July 27. Each previously-released single represents one of the album's acts, as \"Sumo\" represents Light, \"Clout Cobain\" represents Gray, and \"Percs\" represents Dark, which come together cohesively to form Ta13oo. Ta13oo features guest appearances from GoldLink, JID, JPEGMAFIA, ZillaKami and more. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Denzel+Curry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Wes Pentz aka Diplo was born in Tupelo, Mississippi. Most of his childhood was spent in Florida, where his father still owns and runs a bait shop. His youth was spent discussing 'gators with his uncle, working in pop's store and dreaming of dinosaurs living hidden out in the swamp. As he grew up he began to channel these obsessions into music (Miami Bass being a touchstone, of course) and film.\n\nAfter a brief stint at film school and a season out on the shrimp boats, the need to escape from America for a while led to some time in Japan, from where he sent the beat doodles he had been working on to Big Dada in the UK and was promptly signed. He returned to the US and moved to Philly where he and another DJ, Low Budget, began their now-legendary Hollertronix sessions. The Hollertronix mix cd, 'Never Scared' followed and later in the year the lost classic 'Epistemology Suite' EP became his first release for Big Dada.\n\n'Florida' followed soon after, the debut album which he described as \"based loosely on Wiliam Faulkner's 'Go Down Moses' with a definite red clay shrimp and manatee dirty south feel.\" Featuring vocals from Martina Topley-Bird, Vybz Cartel, PEACE, Pantera Os Danadinhos and Sandra Melody, it showed the breadth of Diplo's imagination and the depth of his influences. It was welcomed ecstatically by those who found it but is still to reach the audience it deserved. \n\nSince the record was released, Diplo has become a major star. Starting with the critically-acclaimed and hard-to-find mix cds 'Favela On Blast', 'AEIOU' Vols 1 & 2, M.I.A.'s 'Piracy Funds Terrorism' and 'Hollertronix 2', Pentz built up a reputation as a go-to producer which culminated in his Grammy nomination for MIA's \"Paper Planes.\" Alongside Switch he also started the Major Lazer project and produced for artists including Beyonce, No Doubt, Usher and Justin Bieber. In 2009, Big Dada released \"Decent Work For Decent Pay,\" a compilation of Diplo's productions and remixes.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Disturbed is an American metal band from Chicago, Illinois. The band formed in 1996 when musicians Dan Donegan, Steve \"Fuzz\" Kmak, and Mike Wengren hired David Draiman as their singer. Since the band's formation, they have sold over 13 million albums worldwide, making them one of the largest grossing metal/rock bands in recent years. The band has released five studio albums, four of which have consecutively debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200. They are only the third band in history to achieve this feat. The band went into an indefinite hiatus in October 2011.\nBefore vocalist David Draiman joined Disturbed, they were known as Brawl. Brawl's lineup consisted of vocalist Erich Awalt, guitarist Dan Donegan, drummer Mike Wengren, and bassist Steve \"Fuzz\" Kmak. Before changing their name to \"Brawl\", however, Donegan mentioned in the band's DVD, Decade of Disturbed, that the name was originally going to be \"Crawl\"; they switched it to \"Brawl\", due to the name already being used by another band. Awalt left the band shortly after the recording of a demo tape; the other three members advertised for a singer. They posted an advertisement in the local music publication in Chicago, Illinois, called the \"Illinois Entertainer\". Draiman answered the advertisement after going to twenty other auditions that month. Guitarist Dan Donegan commented on Draiman: \"You know, out of all the singers that we had talked to or auditioned, he  was the only singer who was ready to go with originals. And that impressed me, just to attempt that\".\nWith regard to Draiman being the new singer for the band, Donegan said, \"After a minute or two, he just starts banging out these melodies that were huge...I'm playing my guitar and I'm grinning from ear to ear, trying not to give it away that I like this guy, you know, because I don't want to, you know... 'Yeah, we'll give you a call back. We'll, you know, discuss it.' But I was so psyched. Chill up my spine. I'm like, 'There is something here'.\" As drummer Mike Wengren commented, \"We clicked right off the bat.\" Draiman then joined the band in 1996 and the band was renamed Disturbed. When asked in an interview why he suggested to name the band Disturbed, Draiman said, \"It had been a name I have been contemplating for a band for years. It just seems to symbolize everything we were feeling at the time. The level of conformity that people are forced into was disturbing to us and we were just trying to push the envelope and the name just sorta made sense.\"",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Don Omar (born William Omar Landrón Rivera; February 10, 1978), is a Puerto Rican reggaeton singer-songwriter, recording artist and actor. He is sometimes referred to by his nickname El Rey (Spanish: \"The King\").\nOmar is the oldest son of William Landrón and Luz Antonia Rivera. He was born and raised in Carolina, Puerto Rico. From an early age, he showed interest in the music of Vico C and Brewley MC. During his youth, he became an active member of a Protestant church, Iglesia Evangélica Restauración en Cristo in Bayamón where he occasionally offered sermons. However, after four years, he left the church to dedicate himself to singing.\nHis first public performance in a night club was accompanied by disc jockey Eliel Lind Osorio. Afterwards he appeared regularly on compilation albums from popular DJs and producers including Luny Tunes, Noriega, and DJ Eric. He also worked as a backup singer for the duo Héctor & Tito. One of the members, Héctor Delgado, helped him produce his first solo album.\n\nOmar's career rose to stardom with the release of his first studio album, The Last Don. Both the studio version and its live edition have been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Worldwide, The Last Don: Live  has sold over one million copies, according to his official website. He earned awards for Latin Pop Album of the Year and New Artist & Latin Rap/Hip-Hop Album of the Year by the Billboard Latin Music Awards in 2003. The Last Don: Live  was also nominated for Urban Music Album at the 2005 Latin Grammy Awards.\n\nOmar's May 2006 album King of Kings, became history's highest ranking reggaeton LP in the top 10 US charts, with its debut at #1 on the Latin sales charts and the #1 spot on the Billboard Latin Rhythm Radio Chart with his single “Angelito”. Omar was also able to beat the in-store appearance sales record at Disney World's Virgin music store previously set by pop star Britney Spears.\n\nWith the highest charting debut by a reggaeton artist, Omar's King of Kings entered at No. 7 with 74,000, beating Daddy Yankee's No. 24 entry with 2005's \"Barrio Fino En Directo\". In April 2007, Don Omar received the Latin Billboard award for Reggaeton Album Of The Year for King of Kings. Billboard recognized that King of Kings was the most successful album of the decade in Latin America, besides being the most successful in the history of the genre of reggaeton.

Toliver's solo debut came just a few months later, with debut singles \"I Gotta\" and \"Diva\" dropping in November and December, respectively. Expressing the young musician's equal abilities in contemporary trap and R&B, the singles quickly caught the ear of Atlantic Records, which signed Toliver to the label in March 2018.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Before 2012 Duke Dumont was known as a ‘producer’s producer’. He was the name on a 12” record the DJ knew to reach for when he wanted to please the crowd, without them knowing who had constructed the mesmerising sonic confection they were dancing to.\n\nIn 2012, two EPs on Tiga’s Turbo Recordings (with whom Duke has had a long standing relationship) changed all that. ‘For Club Play Vol. 1 & 2’ offered up sweet ecstatic deep house & UK bass cuts that have united people across the spectrum of music, from early club adopters like Annie Mac, Erol Alkan, Diplo, Martyn and Jackmaster to Fearne Cotton on daytime Radio 1, Trevor Nelson on 1xtra and even podcasts by Tiesto and Avicci. On some nights in Duke’s beloved Fabric London, you would hear the anthemic ‘The Giver’ being played in all three rooms at the same time.\n\nDuke’s early career was mentored by Switch (last sighted producing for Beyoncé) and he made his name as the ‘go-to’ man to remake a pop song for the dance floor (Lily Allen and Bat for Lashes were notable clients). In 2011, he moved out of London to the countryside (Hertfordshire, where his studio overlooks a forest) to focus on his original material.\n\nSynthesizing his influences from techno to UK garage and house he brought back goodies from this zen-like exile. ‘For Club Play Only Vol. 1’ was released in April 2012 on Turbo. With ‘Street Walker’ and ‘Thunderclap’ on there, it alerted the heads to the Duke movement and received support from the likes of Jamie Jones and Simian Mobile Disco.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Adele Emeli Sandé  /sÃ¦nËˆdiË/ san-dee (born 10 March 1987), best known as Emeli Sandé, is a Scottish recording artist and songwriter. Sandé first became known to the public eye after she featured on the track \"Diamond Rings\" by the rapper Chipmunk. It was their first top 10 single on the UK Singles Chart. In 2010, she featured on \"Never Be Your Woman\" by the rapper Wiley, which became another top ten hit. Simon Cowell called Sandé \"his favourite songwriter at the minute\". She has written for a number of artists, including Cher Lloyd, Parade, Susan Boyle, Preeya Kalidas, Leona Lewis, Alesha Dixon, Cheryl Cole, Tinie Tempah, and Mutya Keisha Siobhan.\nIn 2010, she signed a publishing deal with EMI Music Publishing. She later announced that Virgin Records had given her a record deal. Sandé released her first solo single \"Heaven\" in August 2011. Sandé has two number-one singles across the United Kingdom and Ireland with \"Read All About It\" with Professor Green and \"Next to Me\". Her album Our Version of Events peaked at number one in the UK, soon after its release in February 2012 . In 2012 she performed in both the Opening and Closing ceremonies of the London Olympics.\nEmeli Sandé was born to a Zambian father and English mother. She was raised in Alford, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. She studied Medicine at the University of Glasgow, but stopped in her fourth year. She said that education was one of the most important things to her, stating that if her music career failed, she has education to fall back on. Sandé said that her manager, Adrian Sykes, waited patiently since she was 16, \"Adrian really respects that I want to get an education behind me. He also knows my parents are keen that I finish university.\" Sandé has a tattoo of artist Frida Kahlo. At the age of 11, when Sandé was still in primary school, she wrote her first song for a school talent show. She remembers \"That was the first time I thought I might be a songwriter. I always knew I wanted to be a musician and I knew I wanted to write because the people I was listening to all wrote. I never thought it was an option to sing anyone else's songs. The first song she wrote was called \"Tomorrow Starts Again\" - the song had proper structure and even a Middle eight. At the age of 15, Choice FM invited her to London, United Kingdom to take part in a competition they were holding, the \"Rapology\". Richard Blackwood also had her down to MTV's Camden studios to sing gospel. Sandé went to the same secondary school at which her father was a teacher. She said \"I hated to be ill and to miss a day because I was so hungry to learn. I was very shy, nerdy and extremely well-behaved. Inevitably, throughout secondary school, it was part and parcel of my identity that I was Mr Sandé’s daughter. No way could I muck about or get into trouble, because it would've got back to him within minutes. And Dad was strict, let me tell you.\"",

He is the son of the famous Spanish singer Julio Iglesias. Within five years of beginning his musical career in the 1990s, he became the biggest seller of Spanish-language albums of that decade. He made his crossover into the mainstream English language market before the turn of the millennium, signing a multi-album deal with Universal Music Group for an unprecedented US$50,000,000 with Universal Music Latino to release his Spanish albums and Interscope to release English albums. In 2010, he parted with Interscope and signed with another Universal Music Group label, Universal Republic.\nIglesias has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best selling Spanish language artists of all time. He has had five Billboard Hot 100 top five singles, including two number-ones, and holds the record for producing 22 number-one Spanish-language singles on the Billboard's Hot Latin Tracks. He has also had ten number-one songs on Billboard's Dance charts, more than any other single male artist. Altogether, Iglesias has amassed 68 number-one songs on the various Billboard charts. Billboard has called him The King of Latin Pop and The King of Dance. Billboard also named Enrique the number two Latin artist of the years 1986-2011 (Luis Miguel taking the first spot).",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Country singer/songwriter/guitarist Eric Church grew up in Granite Falls, North Carolina, and began singing as a child. At 13, he started writing songs, later teaching himself to play guitar. While attending college at Appalachian State, he formed a band, the Mountain Boys, that played around western North Carolina. After graduating with a degree in marketing, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in country music. It took him a year to get a song publishing deal with Sony/ATV Tree, after which he started getting his songs recorded by other artists, an example being Terri Clark's version of \"The World Needs a Drink.\" He met producer Jay Joyce, who took an interest in him as a recording artist, and they began making demos. That led to his being signed by Capitol Records Nashville. His debut single, \"How 'Bout You,\" was released in early 2006, and it had reached the country Top 20 by the time Capitol released his first album, Sinners Like Me, on July 18, 2006. The album was both a critical and commercial success, and Church followed it up with Carolina in 2009, in which he swung for the contemporary country fences and hit them, scoring two Top Ten singles on the country charts with \"Love Your Love the Most\" (certified gold), and \"Hell on the Heart.\" He scored another gold single with \"Smoke a Little Smoke\" in 2010. He won Top New Solo Vocalist at the Academy of Country Music Awards for that calendar year. After extensive touring, Church released the Caldwell County EP in January of 2011, which reached the number 13 position on the Billboard country chart, as did the single \"Homeboy.\" Church followed with the album Chief in July.\n\nCaught in the Act: Live\nChief wound up as Church's entry into superstardom. Upon its July 2011 release it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and the Top Country Albums chart and soon afterward \"Drink in My Hand\" climbed to the top of the charts, becoming Church's first number one single. Its popularity was eclipsed in the summer of 2012 by \"Springsteen,\" a ballad that also reached number one on the country charts but also crossed over to the pop Top 20. Two other singles were pulled from Chief -- \"Creepin'\" and \"Like Jesus Does\" -- and the album won Album of the Year at the 2012 Country Music Academy Awards. Early in 2013, Church released the live set Caught in the Act, which was recorded at the Tivoli Theatre in Chattanooga, Tennessee in October of 2012; the album debuted at five on the Billboard 200. Church spent the rest of 2013 working on his fourth studio album. The first taste of this new album was the heavy rock of \"The Outsiders,\" a single that turned out to be the album's title track. Preceded by the second single \"Give Me Back My Hometown,\" The Outsiders arrived to considerable anticipation and acclaim in February 2014.",

Ramazzotti is enormously popular in Italy, and is well known in most non-English-speaking European countries and in the Spanish-speaking world, as he has released most of his albums in both Italian and Spanish.\n\nSince 1984, he has released 11 studio albums, one EP, three compilation albums, three live albums, and 37 singles. Ramazzotti has sold over 55 million records in his 25-year career. His repertory includes duets with artists such as Cher, Tina Turner, Andrea Bocelli, Patsy Kensit, Anastacia, Joe Cocker, Ricardo Arjona, Luciano Pavarotti, Laura Pausini, and Ricky Martin.\n\nRamazzotti first gained international success in 1993, with the release of Tutte storie, which amassed six million album sales and occupied the top five in every country where he had previously released albums. This success led to a BMG International record contract in 1994. His audience appeal comes from several factors, including his unique voice, which can be described as somewhat nasal but nevertheless forceful and resonant, and his energetic delivery of catchy, melodic tunes which are often passionate mid-tempo autobiographical ballads, with instrumentation that is rich in soft-rock influence.",

Eurythmics originally came together in 1980 and disbanded in 1990. They reunited in 1999 and split again in 2005. The duo released their first album, In the Garden, in 1981 to little fanfare, but went on to achieve global success with their second album Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This), released in 1983. The title track was a worldwide hit, topping the chart in various countries including the US.\nEurythmics went on to release a string of hit singles and albums before they split in 1990. By this time, Stewart had already embarked on a parallel music career and was also a sought-after record producer, while Lennox began a solo recording career in 1992 with her debut album Diva. After almost a decade apart, Eurythmics reformed in the late 1990s to record their ninth album, Peace which was released in late 1999.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Evanescence is an American rock band founded in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1995 by singer/pianist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody. After recording private albums, the band released their first full-length album, Fallen, on Wind-up Records in 2003. Fallen sold more than 15 million copies  worldwide and helped the band win two Grammy Awards and seven nominations, in addition, Fallen is #6 at the \"Top Bestselling albums of the last 10 Years\". A year later, Evanescence released their first live album, Anywhere but Home, which sold more than one million copies worldwide. In 2006, the band released their second studio album, The Open Door, which sold more than five million copies.\n\nThe line-up of the group has changed several times: David Hodges leaving in 2002, co-founder Moody left in 2003 (mid-tour), bassist Will Boyd in 2006, followed by guitarist John LeCompt and drummer Rocky Gray in 2007. The last two changes led to a hiatus, with temporary band members contributing to tour performances. Billboard ranked Evanescence #71 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart.\n\nAnnounced in June 2009, the newest line-up of the band eventually returned with Evanescence, their self-titled third studio album, released on October 11, 2011. It debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart with 127,000 copies in sales. According to Examiner.com, the album also debuted at #1 on four other different Billboard charts; the Rock Albums, Digital Albums, Alternative Albums, and the Hard Rock Albums charts. The first single, \"What You Want\", was released on August 9, 2011. The second single, \"My Heart Is Broken\", was sent to radio stations in October 31, 2011. The band is currently on tour in promotion of their new album with other bands including The Pretty Reckless and Fair to Midland.\n\nEvanescence was founded by singer, pianist and songwriter Amy Lee and former lead guitarist and songwriter Ben Moody. The two met in 1994 at a youth camp in Little Rock, where Moody heard Lee playing \"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)\" by Meat Loaf on the piano. Their first songs together were \"Solitude\" and \"Give Unto Me\", both written by Lee, and \"Understanding\" and \"My Immortal\", both written by Moody. The songs were edited by both artists, and they shared equal credit.\n\nTwo of Lee and Moody's songs were played on local radio stations, raising local awareness of the group and demand for a concert. The band eventually appeared live, and became one of the most popular acts in the area. After experimenting with band names, such as Childish Intentions and Stricken, they decided on Evanescence, which means \"disappearance\" or \"fading away\" (from the word evanesce, which means \"to disappear\").\n\nThe band released two EPs. The first is the self-titled Evanescence EP (1998), of which about 100 copies were made and distributed at the band's early live performances. The second is the Sound Asleep EP, also known as the Whisper EP (1999). There was also a third EP called Mystary EP. For their first full-length demo CD, Origin, about 2,500 copies were produced and sold to concert audiences. Origin and the EPs contain demo versions of some of the songs on their debut album, Fallen. During a radio interview, Lee and Moody encouraged fans to download the band's older songs from the Internet.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Willie Maxwell II (born June 7, 1991), is an American rapper better known by his stage name Fetty Wap. His first single, \"Trap Queen\", peaked at number two in the U.S. on Billboard Hot 100 in May 2015. This helped Fetty Wap secure a record deal with 300 Entertainment, a record label distributed by Atlantic Records. He subsequently released two Top 10 singles in the U.S., \"679\" and \"My Way\". Fetty Wap's eponymously titled debut album was released in September 2015 and reached number one on Billboard 200 chart.\n\nWillie Maxwell was born on June 7, 1991 and raised in Paterson, New Jersey. Maxwell, born with glaucoma in both eyes, revealed in a 2015 interview that doctors were unable to save his left eye and instead fitted him with an ocular prosthesis. He began taking interest in music in 2013. Initially starting off as only a rapper, he later decided to start singing as well because he \"wanted to do something different\". He was nicknamed \"Fetty\" (slang for money) as he was known for making money. \"Wap\" was added to the end of the name to perform under in tribute to Gucci Mane's alias, GuWop.\n\nFetty Wap has referred to his music as \"ignorant R&B\". He utilizes the Auto-Tune pitch correction effect, as well as combining singing and rapping.\n\nFetty Wap usually wears the flag of Haiti in honor of his daughter's grandmother who had died and draws influences from Haitian culture. In an interview with CivilTV, he said that he \"fell in love with the culture; people don't know what Haiti means to me.\" He also talked about how unity has built his career and how it overpowers everything. He explained that he didn't really grow up off of love and mentions the struggles he has had. Still, he had felt the mutual love for the Haitian people, and stresses that he does not wear the flag for the looks, but for appreciation. On several occasions, Fetty Wap has also cited Atlanta-based rapper Gucci Mane as a major influence in his music.\n\nFetty Wap is the father of three children. As of 2016, he co-stars with Masika Kalysha, the mother of his youngest baby Khari, on VH1's Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood which will document their relationship as new parents.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Tramar Dillard (born December 16, 1979) better known by his stage name Flo Rida , is an American rapper and singer-songwriter. He released his debut album, Mail on Sunday, in March 2008. His debut single \"Low\", featuring T-Pain, was a No. 1 hit for ten weeks in United States in early 2008. Two other singles resulted from Mail on Sunday: \"Elevator\" and \"In the Ayer\". In 2009, his second album R.O.O.T.S. was released; its most successful single \"Right Round\" was at the top of the Hot 100 for six weeks. Since then, he has released his third studio album titled Only One Flo (Part 1), which will see a sequel titled Wild Ones.\n\nTramar Dillard was born in the 187th Street projects of Carol City, Florida. His mother raised him and his seven sisters, some of whom sang in a local gospel group.\n\nDillard's brother-in-law was a hypeman for local rap group 2 Live Crew, and while in ninth grade, Dillard formed his own amateur group with some friends called the GroundHoggz. Born and raised in Miami, the GroundHoggz formed in the 187 apartments in Carol City. Similar to Goodie Mob, they were making music for the love of the art and to feed their souls. With only three members, 1Bred, Key Lime, and Fist, they found their missing link when Flo Rida, who lived in the same apartments, spit a verse for them. They were instantly impressed. Together for eight years, they started recording at underground studios in Carver Ranches. His work with 2 Live Crew member Fresh Kid Ice attracted the attention of DeVante Swing, a member of the band Jodeci. However, he was rejected by several of the major labels, so he sought many other jobs outside of music.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1998, he studied international business management at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas for two years and attended Barry University for two months. He returned to Florida to continue pursuing his music career after receiving a phone call from a representative of the independent label Poe Boy Entertainment.\n\nDillard signed with Poe Boy in 2006, and as Flo Rida he began affiliating with other artists, such as Rick Ross, Trina, T-Pain, and Trick Daddy. A promotional street single entitled \"Birthday\", featuring Rick Ross, was his first significant release. He made his debut guest appearance with the song \"Bitch I'm from Dade County\" on DJ Khaled's album We the Best, which featured Trick Daddy, Trina, Rick Ross, Brisco, C-Ride, and Dre.",

Growing up, he was consumed by playing football and rapping, describing them as his two favorite childhood hobbies. In 1996, French emigrated with his parents and two younger brothers to the Bronx in New York City. His father left the family when French was 17, and so he began to provide for his mother and younger brothers.  French is also often reported as being of partial Somali descent. Asked about the rumors during a phone-in interview with Nomad Radio, a UK-based Somali music station, he indicated that both of his parents were Moroccan but that he has Somali ancestry as well.  Montana is Muslim (Sunni), having been raised in Morocco under the Maliki madhab, or school of thought. In an interview for Vlad TV which took place on the first day of the Islamic Holy Month Ramadan, French revealed that he participates in fasting during the month and how he was shot in the head and beat a murder charge.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Frédéric François Chopin ( Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin) born 1 March or 22 February 1810 – 17 October 1849, was a Polish composer and virtuoso pianist. He is widely considered one of the greatest Romantic composers. Chopin was born in Żelazowa Wola, a village in the Duchy of Warsaw. A renowned child-prodigy pianist and composer, he grew up in Warsaw and completed his music education there; he composed many of his mature works in Warsaw before leaving Poland in 1830 at age 20, shortly before the November 1830 Uprising.\nFollowing the Russian suppression of the Uprising, he settled in Paris as part of Poland's Great Emigration. During the remaining 19 years of his life, Chopin gave only some 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon; he supported himself by selling his compositions and teaching piano. After some romantic dalliances with Polish women, including an abortive engagement, from 1837 to 1847 he carried on a relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin, aka George Sand. For most of his life Chopin suffered from poor health; he died in Paris in 1849 at age 39.\nThe vast majority of Chopin's works are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces and some songs to Polish lyrics. His piano works are often technically demanding, with an emphasis on nuance and expressive depth. Chopin invented the instrumental ballade and made major innovations to the piano sonata, mazurka, waltz, nocturne, polonaise, étude, impromptu, scherzo and prélude.",

It’s not hype. It’s not a hit. It’s not an image. It’s all of the above, the product of diligence that only a true fan understands; G reinterprets what he loves, not what everyone wants to hear, but in 2011 its looking like those two paths are starting to merge.\n\nGʼs been a fixture on the local New Orleans rap scene for a few years and more recently in the music blogosphere, but in the last few months his popularity has surged and as his national profile has grown exponentially. His latest mixtape, The Endless Summer, produced Runaround Sue, who’s sun stroked throwback video garnered over 100,000 plays on Youtube in the first week.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Gavin James (born Gavin Wigglesworth on 5 July 1991) is an Irish singer-songwriter. In March 2013 and March 2016, he won the Choice Music Prize Irish Song of the Year award.\n\nJames won Ireland's answer to the Mercury (the Choice Music Prize for 'Song of the Year') and saw his debut EP ('Say Hello') remain on the Irish chart for over 6 months. This rise and development in his home market has gained James sell-out headline dates and wider support tours with the likes of Lianne La Havas, Beth Orton, Kodaline and Marina & The Diamonds. \n\nA snapshot of this ascent, 'Live at Whelans' is a selection of new and old songs performed in the stripped-back environment of a rapturously-received hometown show. The first track to be lifted from it, 'Nervous', is a pin-drop account of a one-sided relationship: from that initial fear of your first meeting to the gradual realisation, by the end of the song, that perhaps they were never who you thought they were (and it's best to forget about them).\n\nJames released his eagerly-anticipated debut album, ‘Bitter Pill’ on March 11th 2016 – having already gone Top 5, been certified Platinum and winner of Choice Music Prize’s ‘Song of the Year’ in his native Ireland in 2013 and 2016. Following a sold-out London show at KOKO, support across Spotify (Spotlight Artists for 2016), Radio 1, Virgin Radio, Beats 1 and Radio X, Gavin had an extensive UK tour, European tour, US tour and Australian dates, that featured Shepherd’s Bush Empire on October 7th 2016 in London and 3Arena on December 2016 in Dublin.

From the beginning on, Gente de Zona has always enjoyed a huge acceptance from their audience and within a couple of months they were playing in the trendiest Havanna Clubs such as Casa de la Musica de Galiano, Casa de la Musica de Miramar, Makumba, Johnny Dream and Delirio Habanero. At the moment Gente de Zona is the hottest act in Cuba and their fans are coming from far away to join the gigs.  They are the definitely the most expected at any European Latino Festival. A proof of that was their last tour \"Tournée Verano Europeo 2009\" as they called which finished with a great concert in Italy. But they also went to Copenhagen in Denmark, Koln in Germany, Milano, Rome, Florence and Verona in Italy - among other places in that country, Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia in Spain, Rotterdam and Amsterdam in Holland, Gent in Belgium, Zurich in Switzerland and Tampera in Finland. Their fans follow them from just about anyhere. As they say \"it is just imposible to listen to their music and keep your body still. Their music call out for dancing. You just cannot help. You have to move your body to that beat that touches your heart and plays right inside your soul\".  Alexander Ale takes over the stage with his dynamic, afro-Hispanic blood and rocks off on the dance floor. He began in December 2000 at the rap festival de Alamar. \"At that time, we were only a rap-duo\", announced Alexis. \"As time went by, we became a part of Brigada Hermanos Saiz and attempted our first steps together with Empresa Musical Antonio Maria Romeu where we could rise up to real professionals. But not until July 2005 did we officially appear in the catalogue of the Agencia Cubana de Rap.\"  Jakob Forever Through Jacobs veins flows Spanish blood, however spiced with plenty of salsa. He comes from Camaguey and one calls him the Leader of swing rapero. His career started rather noncommercial - imitating songs from the Back Street Boys and N'Sync but performing on roller-skates. In this formation, Jacob traveled to Spain where he now lives. Returning to Cuba, he launched the group Made in Cuba.  Nando Pro Nando is a pianist from Matanzas and has been loving rap and Reggaeton from the beginning. He's working as a composer und producer for different rappers an Cubatoneros like Papa Records, which whom he won first price at the Feria del Cubadisco in 2006. He also helped to establish the musical production of the album \"Acento Latino\" together with Eddy K  The group is back to Cuba after the great success of its latest European Tour and is now ready to go to Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Ecuador and many other countries in South, North and Central Americas. Miami, New York, Los Angeles and Houston are some of the cities in the United States which call for them. But the political situation involving the US and Cuba does not grant them the opportunity to meet their fans in those countries. \"We hope we can go to the United States next year - says Alexander - for we understand the importance of meeting our fans and going where they are. We do not wanna go to the US to talk about politics or politicians. Our goal is to go their and make those people who have been hungry for us listen tou our music live and dance.\" For further information about this group visit: www.myspace.com/mundogdz www.facebook.com/gentedezona  Cesar Melo Tour Manager GdZ Europa +41 76 239 3257 caninz@gmail.com .",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Luigino Celestino Di Agostino (born 17 December 1967), better known by his stage name Gigi D'Agostino, is an Italian DJ, remixer and record producer. In 1986, he started his career as a DJ-spinning Italo Disco, and releasing his first mix, titled \"Psychodelic\".\nBorn in Turin, D'Agostino spent his childhood between his native city of Turin and Brescia, where the Media Records studios are located. As a child, D'Agostino wanted to be someone in the world of disco music. Starting out working as a stonemason and a fitter, he began his musical career as a DJ by organizing parties in clubs. His debut was in a club near Turin called \"Woodstock\". He was a resident DJ of an Italian disco named Ultimo Impero from 1993 to 1998. D'Agostino's first release was Noise Makers Theme, a double-A sided record with a track by Daniele Gas on the other side, which launched the Noise Maker label, under the direction of Italian house producer Gianfranco Bortolotti. D'Agostino would continue working with Gas, as well as Mauro Picotto's production team in the following years. His 1999 single \"Bla Bla Bla\" became a major hit in Europe. He described the single as \"a piece I wrote thinking of all the people who talk and talk without saying anything!\" As a DJ, D'Agostino is known as one of the \"pioneers of Mediterranean Progressive Dance,\" consisting of minimalistic sounds and Latin and Mediterranean melodies. As a record producer, D'Agostino's uses the pseudonym \"Gigi Dag\"; he transforms a piece, originally destined for the discos, into a success for the mainstream public.\nAfter successes like the track \"Sweetly\", he joined the team of Bortolotti, the general manager of Media Records and suddenly reached the top of the hit parades. His single \"FLY\", published in 1996 with BXR Noise Maker, the label created by Media Records for the Mediterranea progressive house, reached the top of the sales in Italy. This was followed by his single \"Gigi's Violin\".\nSubsequently, D'Agostino released the song \"Angel's Symphony\" with R.A.F. by Mauro Picotto, a friend from Media Records. His biggest project was the self-titled album Gigi D'Agostino, consisting of 19 tracks, which sold over 60,000 copies.\nAfter his rise to success, D'Agostino's musical style changed, with his sound becoming more melodic, at midway between house and progressive, with more energetic and melodious sonorities and less obsessive rhythms, also known as Italo dance.\nIn 1997, he released the single \"Gin Lemon\", followed by \"Your love Elisir\" (1998), \"Cuba Libre\" (1999), and \"Bla Bla Bla\" (1999). He later released the album Eurodance Compilation, which contained five unpublished tracks. With this compilation, he earned a platinum disc and was awarded with the \"Best Producer in 1999\" award at the Italian Dance Awards. In October, D'Agostino released another hit single, entitled \"Another Way\".\nIn 1999, his album L'Amour Toujours (released in 2001 in the United States) included 23 tracks on two CDs, with the hit song \"L'Amour Toujours\" bringing him to the 10th position in the sales parade in Italy; as a result, he earned another Platinum Disc.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Gloria Trevi (born Gloria de los Ángeles Treviño Ruiz on February 15, 1968 in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico) is a Mexican singer-songwriter. She was described as the \"Supreme Diva of the Mexican Pop\" by the music channel VH1 and sold over 20 million records. Her new album De Película was released in 2013.\n\nTrevi released her first album in 1989, ¿Qué Hago Aquí? (What am I doing here). The album scored an instant number one hit, \"Dr. Psiquiatra\", and four other songs from the album climbed the charts. Trevi followed her first record with Tu Ángel de la Guarda (Your guardian angel), which was more successful than the first. Pelo Suelto became her most widely known hit, reaching number one all over Latin America and Spain as well as becoming popular with the Latino population of the United States. Her third album, Me siento tan sola (I feel SO lonely), was released in 1992 garnering another hit, Zapatos Viejos (Old Shoes). All three albums were recorded in Los Angeles.\n\nHer manager recruited young girls to talent camps and molested them. Trevi was initially indicted, was held in prison, but ultimately found innocent as she was not aware of the rape being committed by her manager.\n\nIn 1993, Trevi was nominated for Pop Female Artist of the Year at the Lo Nuestro Awards.\nIn 2000, Trevi, Andrade, and backup singer Maria Raquenel Portillo were arrested in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on charges of corrupting minors. A year later, Trevi announced that she was pregnant while in prison; the father of the child was Andrade, according to DNA tests by the Brazilian authorities (Trevi and her defence claimed that the results of the DNA test were doctored). Trevi was cleared of the charges in 2004, due to lack of evidence, after spending four years and eight months in prison.\n\nTrevi married Armando Gómez, a lawyer, in 2009. She now lives in McAllen, Texas. She will star as the protagonist (alongside with Gabriel Soto) in Emilio Larrosa's telenovela: Libre para amarte. Trevi's ninth album \"De Pelicula\" was released on September 24, 2013. The albums' two singles \"No Soy Un Pájaro\" (released in both Pop and Banda Versions)  and \"No Querías Lastimarme\" were issued as the albums' singles. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gloria+Trevi\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Known for some of the biggest remixes from the last year, such as his remix of Tove Lo’s “Talking Body,” Maroon 5’s “Animals,” Years & Years’ “Desire,” and more, this gifted up-and-comer has already seen a significant amount of success, hitting #1 on Hype Machine consistently, on top of racking up 100 million streams online.\n\nAlthough Gryffin has recently been on the cusp of a major breakthrough, he began his musical journey growing up as a classically trained pianist, before expanding his sonic palette with guitar at an early age. He played in bands to initially hone his instrumental abilities, until he dove head first into the world of music production at the University of Southern California. Throughout college and beyond, Gryffin further refined his skills that have blossomed into his artistic mastery that is appreciated by his counterparts and adoring fans around the world. In his genre, artists typically DJ to showcase their talents, but live performance is where his heart lies in capturing the essence of his work.\n\nWith a world-debut at this past SnowGlobe Music Festival, Gryffin unveiled his anticipated live performance to finally connect with those who have been behind his impressive play counts. His passion and love for musicianship, and artistry within music shined through as he performed with live instrumentation (guitar, keyboard, synths, & drum pads) in a continuous dance music format to keep up the energy characteristic of DJ sets. Since this performance was a resounding success, the excitement is brewing for his next two sold-out shows at Los Angeles’ The Roxy, and New York’s Bowery Ballroom to close out his first-ever live tour.\nFollowing the conclusion of the tour, Gryffin made the leap to his first original production, “Heading Home” featuring Josef Salvat, which immediately became #1 on Spotify’s Global Viral 50 chart, US Viral Chart, and accumulated a million plays in one week after being released via Darkroom/Interscope Records. It’s already looking like 2016 is going to be Gryffin’s biggest year yet.  ",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Ashley Nicolette Frangipane (born September 29, 1994), known professionally as Halsey, is an American singer and songwriter. Gaining attention from self-released music on social media platforms, she was signed by Astralwerks in 2014 and released her debut EP, Room 93, later that year.\n\nHalsey has since earned one number-one album on the Billboard 200 with Hopeless Fountain Kingdom (2017), as well as two number-two albums with Badlands (2015) and Manic (2020). She has earned two number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, including \"Closer\", a collaboration with The Chainsmokers, and \"Without Me\"; she has also attained a top-five single with \"Bad at Love\". In total, Halsey has sold over one million albums and has been streamed over six billion times in the United States. All three of her studio albums have been supported by a headlining tour. \n\nFrangipane started writing music when she was 17, and in 2012 she began posting videos to social media sites such as YouTube and Kik, and in particular Tumblr, under the username of se7enteenblack. She became known for a parody of Taylor Swift's song \"I Knew You Were Trouble\", inspired by Swift's relationship with Harry Styles. She then wrote a follow up song about their relationship which was posted online in early 2013. In early 2014, Frangipane went to a party and met a \"music guy\" who asked her to collaborate on a song with him because he liked her voice. The result, a song about her ex-boyfriend titled \"Ghost\", was posted by Frangipane on SoundCloud several weeks after it was recorded. Within hours, the song gained online popularity, and she was subsequently contacted by several record labels, with the song eventually charting and going on radio. She signed with Astralwerks, feeling that they gave her more creative freedom than other labels that contacted her.\n\nFollowing this, Frangipane played numerous acoustic shows in different cities under several stage names. She chose Halsey as her permanent stage name because it is an anagram of her first name, and is also a reference to the Halsey Street station of the New York City Subway in Brooklyn, a place she spent a lot of time at when she was a teenager. She also stated Halsey was the most popular name she used. Having written poems for years, Halsey began writing more serious songs as a way to promote them. Music became Halsey's \"confessional approach\" and a form of therapy after the difficult life she had endured.",

Hardwell's overall talent is recognised by the dance music industry as a new, exciting and refreshing take on a scene that continues to evolve and with an apparent everlasting shelf life!  \"Guess What\", a recent co-production with Chuckie, is likely to be one of the most played underground house records of the past two years, his \"Show Me Love vs. Be\" bootleg of Steve Angello and Sebastien Ingrosso's track was one of the biggest dance hits of last year and \"MRKRSTFT\" has been included in almost all of the house compilations of 2008.   On top of this pronounced success stories, Hardwell has also topped the leading Dutch chart 'Dance-Tunes.com' a grand total of 6 times in the past 12 months. He has also taken up remix duties for artists such as Chris Lake, Funkerman, Laidback Luke, Sharam (Deep Dish), Steve Angello, Booty Luv and Hi_Tack amongst others...need we go on?  Behind the decks Hardwell never fails to deliver, his exceptional technical skills, variety of music and that added personal touch make him stand out, and he's ready to bring this to the masses.

In 2013, Miller moved to Denver, where he continues to reside. He also enrolled in (but never finished) the music-business program at the University of Colorado Denver while working on his first EP. In the meantime, he coached lacrosse and delivered sushi to support himself.",

Her fan club name is U-ana (Uaena), where each syllable has a different meaning: \"you\" is from English, \"ae\" is Sino-Korean for \"love\", and \"na\" is Korean for \"me\". In 2012, IU ranked #19 on \"The 23rd Annual Independent Critics List of the 100 Most Beautiful Faces.\"\n\nIU debuted on Mnet M! Countdown on September 18, 2008 with her debut single \"Lost Child\". It was later released as the title track for her debut mini-album Lost and Found on September 24, 2008. However, she did not gain mainstream popularity until her follow-up and debut studio album Growing Up.\n\nOn April 16, 2009, IU launched her first full album, titled Growing Up, with the lead promotional number \"Boo\". Within three weeks, \"Boo\" went up to the No.1 contenders for SBS Inkigayo, and her name also went up twice on Take 7 together with other notable artists like SG Wannabe and Younha. The song also did well on KBS Music Bank K-Chart, on Mnet M! Countdown chart, and on various online music charts.\n\nIn 2009, IU sang the ending title song, \"Araro\", for the acclaimed MBC drama Queen Seon Duk, where she was recommended by the director, Sam Kim, citing her \"clear tone and her lyrical sensibility\". She was also featured on Mighty Mouth's album Love Class in the song \"희망사항\". In late 2009, IU recorded MC Mong's song \"Love Letter to You\" featuring SHINee's Key as the rapper.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Intocable (Untouchable) is a Tejano/Norteño musical group from Zapata, Texas that was started by friends Ricky Muñoz and René Martínez in the early 90's. Within a couple years as a band, Intocable had already risen to the top of the Tejano and Norteño fields with a musical signature that had fused Tejano's robust conjunto and Norteño folk rhythms with a pop balladry. Currently, Intocable could very well be the most influential group in Tejano, and their tough Tejano/Norteño fusion has become the blueprint for dozens of Tex-Mex groups. The group's strengths, which include romantic hooky melodies, and tight instrumentation and vocal harmony is consistently being imitated by a list of other Tejano and Norteño groups. This list includes groups such as Imán, Duelo, Costumbre, Solido, Estruendo, Intenso, and Zinzero among others.\n\nCareer accomplishments include four consecutive sold-out nights at Mexico City's prestigious Auditorio Nacional and the group's 2003 headlining appearance at Reliant Stadium in Houston, which drew a record 70,104 fans. They also played two sold-out dates at the 10,000-capacity Monterrey Arena in Monterrey, Mexico. It was an unusual accomplishment, given that Norteño groups typically play large dance halls and rarely arenas, unless it's an all day festival event. Intocable has also won at least eight of Univision's Premio Lo Nuestro awards, and received their first Grammy win in February 2005 at the 47th Annual Grammys (Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album Album; Intimamente) and second at the 53rd annual Grammys for their album Classic.\n\nIntocable also made history by being the first of their genre to play at the famed Dallas Cowboys Stadium at the halftime show of the 2011 Dallas Cowboys vs. Washington Redskins game. They walked away with two of the 5 nominations to the Billboard Regional Mexican Awards and got a nod for Best Norteño Album to the 2011 Latin Grammy for their album INTOCABLE 2011. They were also nominated for a Grammy with the successful album. INTOCABLE 2011 was released under the group’s own music label Good I Music and landed the first two singles “Robarte Un Beso” and “Prometi” to #1 in US regional radio. The 3rd single “Arrepientete” also did very well on radio and their 4th single \"Llueve\" was premiered live onstage at the 2012 Premio lo Nuestro where the group swept with all three categories they were nominated for.\n\nLife hasn't always been this kind to the group, though. The band's first indie albums barely sold. In August 1994 their album Fuego Eterno, with new label EMI Latin, had notable sales. The music of Ramón Ayala influenced the direction of the band. The band's lead vocalist and accordion player, Ricky Muñoz has stated that his biggest inspiration is Ramón Ayala. In 1997, the band suffered its first major setback when two members of the band left the group to form their own. Johnny lee Rosas, (bajo sexto and 2nd voice), and Albert Ramirez, (bass), formed Grupo Masizzo. Rosas, rejoined the group in 2003 after 4 successful solo albums.",

At age 17, he moved to the United States. He moved to Oklahoma and New York to learn English and was influenced by the music he heard there. He then returned to Medellín and gained popularity performing at clubs in the city.\nHis breakthrough came in 2014 with the single \"6 AM\" featuring Puerto Rican singer Farruko which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. The song, along with the single \"Ay Vamos\", bolstered sales of his album La Familia (2014). In 2016, he released Energia, which included the hit singles \"Ginza\", \"Bobo\", \"Safari\", and \"Sigo Extranandote\". In June 2017, J Balvin released the single \"Mi Gente\" featuring Willy William. On 1 August 2017, \"Mi Gente\" topped the Global Top 50 on Spotify, and later reached one billion views on YouTube. The song, and its remix featuring American artist Beyoncé, helped J Balvin achieve international fame. In January 2018, he released the hit single \"Machika\" featuring Jeon and Anitta. He collaborated with Cardi B and Bad Bunny on the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \"I Like It\".\n\nThough his music is primarily reggaeton, J Balvin has experimented with a variety of musical genres in his work, including electronica, house music, trap, and R&B. His original musical inspirations were rock groups such as Metallica and Nirvana. He has collaborated with artists such as Pharrell Williams, Major Lazer, and Sean Paul. Despite working with many English-speaking artists, J Balvin continues to sing almost exclusively in Spanish, and hopes to introduce Spanish-language music to a global audience. He is also noted for his eclectic and colorful fashion sense.",

He successfully matriculated to Mary McCleod Bethune Middle School where he continued to compete in talent shows winning every year; two at Bethune Middle and one at the Dekalb County Middle School Talent Show. \n\nIn 2007, Jacquees was introduced to his manager, Orlando Grind, by Dexx Lee. After years of performing in local talent shows, Orlando soon introduced him to Russell \"Block\" Spencer, founder and CEO of Block Entertainment. When Jacquees started going to the studio he merely blended with the team and wasn't given the opportunity to express his true talents. \"When you see work being done around you but not for you, you tend to get discouraged,\" says Jacquees. At that time, Block's focus was only rap, not R&B. It wasn't until summer of 2009 when Block witnessed how talented Jacquees was and shifted his vision. Jacquees began to work closely with Block Entertainment recording and gaining more exposure with the release of his first single \"Krazy\" featuring Grand Hustle's own, T.I. \n\nJacquees has recorded with label mates, Gorilla Zoe and Scotty, T.I.P, and an upcoming Atlanta rapper, J-Real. Jacquees dreams to work with established artist Lil Wayne, Drake, Justin Bieber, Bow Wow, Lil' Chuckee, Chris Brown, and many more. \"All of these artists started out at the age I am and are successful in the industry. I look up to them and dream that I will be just as successful as they are,\" Jacquees explains. \"Only better!\" \n\n\"It's truly a blessing to have the opportunity to work with the artist and producers I have already worked with,\" says Jacquees. \"I pray to God every night that I continue on this journey and achieve what I've always dreamed of doing. With God on my side, I know this is only the beginning and there is more to come.\" With that in mind, Jacquees will achieve any and everything he wants out of the music industry.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/IAMJACQUEES\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jacquees\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "strBiographyEN" : "For anyone looking to brand Jason Aldean as part of a significant musical movement, good luck. \nThere’s a lot about the singer that’s become familiar during his five years as a country hitmaker, after all, he has spent more weeks at #1 on the radio charts than any other country artist in the last 12 months. But none of what he does comes out quite like anyone else. The blues-tinged licks at the end of his phrases—there’s a ring of familiarity about them, but you can’t really link them to another artist. The smoky guitar riffs that have become a signature—they’re built on sounds that have come before, but they don’t really belong to anyone else in the country genre, either. The small-town themes that pervade many of his songs—that’s all been done before, but not quite with the unwavering honesty that Aldean applies to the subject.\n\nSince his 2005 debut with the scorching “Hicktown,” the singer has set himself apart from the pack as a truly unique artist. He addresses his Georgia-born brand of country music with a singular vision, and he intends to keep it that way.\n\n“The whole thing about being creative is coming up with new things,” he says matter-of-factly in a converted barn on his Nashville-area farm. “What makes you different and more creative than the other guys is taking something to an extreme and making it better without ripping anybody else off. I think that’s the key. The great ones figure it out and are constantly evolving, and that’s what makes ‘em great.”\n\nWith My Kinda Party, the Academy of Country Music’s former Top New Male Vocalist further cements his uniqueness with a robust15-track project that builds on his personal past while covering new territory. The first single—the muscular title track—fit very quickly into the jacked-up portion of his concert set list, which already boasts “She’s Country,” “Crazy Town” and “Johnny Cash.” But there’s other stylistic landscape to explore, too—his first full-fledged duet, with big-voiced pop singer Kelly Clarkson; and an almost rap segment in “Dirt Road Anthem” that suggests Aldean has listened to a little Snoop Dogg in his time.\n\nThe first single from My Kinda Party is the title track, which debuted on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart at #41. The song has become Aldean’s tenth Top 10 hit on that chart. The song also debuted at #54 on the Hot 100 chart. “My Kinda Party” was written and originally recorded by southern rock singer-songwriter Brantley Gilbert for his 2009 album Modern Day Prodigal Son.\n\nThe album also includes a duet with Kelly Clarkson called “Don’t You Wanna Stay”, which debuted on the country charts from unsolicited airplay at #59 for the week of November 20, 2010. The song also debuted at #93 on the Hot 100 chart. Aldean and Clarkson performed this song at the 44th Annual CMA Awards on November 10, 2010.\n\nThis album also contains the country rap-themed “Dirt Road Anthem”, which was previously recorded separately by both of its writers, Brantley Gilbert and Colt Ford. According to The Boot, Aldean’s publicist teased about this song, suggesting Aldean listened to “a little Snoop Dogg in his time”; regarding the song, Aldean said that he did not consider “Dirt Road Anthem” a rap song.\n\nThat might come as a shock to non-country observers who think the genre belongs in its own self-imposed hay-bale ‘hood, but Aldean gets around musically. He was the first country artist of any significance to incorporate Guns N’ Roses medleys into his live show—“You’re welcome” is his simple response—and his listening history includes such diverse talents as Aerosmith, the Oak Ridge Boys and even Tupac Shakur.\n\nLike Aldean himself, all of those acts were founded on a distinct musical identity. They each incorporated their heroes’ influences into a sound that belonged to no one else. Aldean took his cues from them quite well.\n\n“I grew up listenin’ to all kinds of music—rock and Southern rock and country and blues and rap stuff, too,” he says. “My cousin, who’s five months older than me, he went through his rap phase when we had 2Pac in the car all the time. Really, I’m a fan of all kinds of music.”\n\nWhile critics will gravitate to the extremes on My Kinda Party, the essence of the album is simply the solidity of its material. By selling 3.5 million records in the first phase of his career, Aldean commanded the attention of Nashville’s songwriters as he put together music for the album. With volumes of Music Row’s best craftsmen and women writing for Aldean, he literally had the pick of the litter.\n\nAs a result, My Kinda Party is stocked with inviting melodies and intriguing storylines, many of them tugging on the small-town themes that have become the backbone of his persona. “Fly Over States,” “Church Pew” and “Tattoos On This Town” exemplify Aldean’s affection for the topic, though it’s often misunderstood. \n\nWhile country has plenty of bumper-sticker anthems that celebrate small communities, Aldean is more than a simple cheerleader for rural values. He does indeed take on the role of heartland defender in “Fly Over States,” but other songs find him grappling with the heartbreak and limitations that accompany towns with three- and four-digit populations.\n\n“I’m not like a pro-backwoods, flag-wavin’ kinda guy,” he says. “I mean, I grew up in the South, in the country, and I love that lifestyle. But I’m not one of those guys that insists that’s the only thing there is. Being from a small town, you can be a little misunderstood, and there are plenty of people tryin’ to get out of there because you’re put in a box a lot of times when you’re in a small town.”\n\nAldean knows that issue well. Born in Macon, Georgia, he was raised on the outskirts of town and devoted much of his youth to working and hanging out at his cousin’s 200-acre farm.\n\n“I spent every weekend out there at his house riding four-wheelers and horses, bailin’ hay, going fishing and hunting—all that stuff,” Aldean reflects. “When I would go from my house to his house, it was a lot of farmland and dirt roads and huge potholes in the road.”\n\nA high-school athlete, he made use of his environment by playing clubs, building his musical skills with an eye toward Nashville. Once he hit Music City in 1998, Aldean struggled rather famously, signing several recording contracts that eventually fell apart. He played countless label showcases and eventually drained his bank account.\n\nAs dramatic as it sounds, he was ready to pack it up and go back to Georgia when producer Michael Knox asked him to take one more crack at a showcase. Independent Broken Bow Records was interested, and Aldean—admittedly skeptical that a then-unproven company was going to make a difference in his life—took that shot.\n\nEverything clicked at that show. Aldean got a deal that kept him in Nashville, and his life has never quite been the same. But his brush with permanent obscurity still fuels his creativity.\n\n“I think about it every day,” he concedes. “When you read that I was this close to leaving, it sounds like something made up. But it was the truth. I had applied for jobs in Georgia, and I was trying to get hired down there. We were broke—just straight-up broke—and we were gonna move in with my mom so we could get on our feet and get straightened out…maybe get a club gig and try to build a local following.” \n\nInstead, the Broken Bow deal allowed Aldean to stay in Nashville and build up a following on a national level. Establishing a mindset that he continues to carry, he tackled his opportunity on his own terms. He worked with his own producer, Michael Knox, and used his own band—guitarist Kurt Allison, bass player Tully Kennedy and drummer Rich Redmond—plus guitarist Adam Shoenfeld as his studio core.\n\nAldean’s ultra-Southern voicings give him an immediately identifiable sound. The band helps set him even further apart from other country stars.\n\n“I don’t want to use who everybody else uses,” he insists. “And I don’t want my records to sound like everybody else’s records. The only way to do that is to cut it like we do. I cut the album with my band, I use an engineer that nobody else really uses in this town to cut major-label records, and Michael is starting to produce more things now, but when we first got started, it was me and that was about it.”\n\nEven now, as Knox branches out to work with other well-known country artists—an opportunity that’s come directly from producing Aldean—Knox and Aldean have an understanding about protecting the sound they’ve achieved together.\n\n“I just went to him and said, ‘Hey, look, man, this is something that we’ve been working 10 years on. I’m not going to just hand it over so you can make everybody else’s stuff sound like mine. That’s what sets us apart.’ He understood that, and that was pretty much it.”\n\nThere’s no cockiness and no forcefulness in his stance. The name of the game is individuality, and Aldean is protecting it.\n\nHe also appreciates it in other artists. That same level of uniqueness is exactly what Aldean was looking for when he approached Clarkson as a duet partner on “Don’t You Wanna Stay.”\n\n“Kelly has such a distinct voice,” he observes. “She’s got the most soulful voice there is right now. As soon as she opened her mouth and started singing in the studio, it was like, ‘That is what this song is supposed to sound like!’”\n\nThe one-of-a-kind sound Clarkson brought to “Don’t You Wanna Stay” is representative of Aldean’s own artistry throughout My Kinda Party. There’s a cultural familiarity to the themes and the influences, but in practice, there’s not another act who sounds quite like Jason Aldean. He’s not part of some musical wave. He is his own movement.\n\n“That’s what it’s all about,” he shrugs, “knowing what it is that sets you apart from everybody else.”\n\nIt is important to note, two of Jason Aldean’s tracks on his recent album “My Kinda Party,” were written by another Georgia artist, Brantley Gilbert, who still performs these tracks as singles from his albums. Although some fans believe that there is bad blood between the two singers, this is not true. They have performed “Dirt Road Anthem” together with Colt Ford (the artist with whom Gilbert first recorded this duet) and Gilbert has posted YouTube videos entreating his fans to appreciate the fact that Aldean gave his songs more of an audience than he could have ever hoped for otherwise at the time.",

Wu's music studio was later sold to Alfa Music, and the new manager Yang Jun Rong asked him to release his own album. Chou already had an arsenal of songs he wrote for others but had been rejected, so among those he chose 10 for his debut CD Jay that was released in 2000. The album established his reputation as a musically gifted singer-songwriter whose style is a fusion of R&B, rap, classical music, and yet distinctly Chinese. His fame spread quickly in Chinese-speaking regions including countries throughout Southeast Asia. Since 2000, Chou has released one album per year, except the year 2009, each selling several million copies, and has been recognized with hundreds of awards. In 2003, he was the cover story of Time magazine (Asia version), acknowledging his influence on popular culture. He has held four world tours, \"The One\" (2002), \"Incomparable\" (2004), \"Jay Chou The World Tours\" (2007–2008) and \"The Era\" (2010–2011) performing in cities such as Taipei, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore, Las Vegas, Toronto and Vancouver. Unlike most singers, Chou has an enormous amount of creative control over his music. He is not only the songwriter but also the producer on all of his albums; since 2005 he is also the music director and also directs his own music videos.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Johann Sebastian Bach (31 March  1685 – 28 July 1750) was a German composer, organist, harpsichordist, violist, and violinist of the Baroque period. He enriched many established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Many of Bach's works are still known today, such as the Brandenburg Concertos, the Mass in B minor, the The Well-Tempered Clavier, his cantatas, chorales, partitas, Passions, and organ works. His music is revered for its intellectual depth, technical command, and artistic beauty.\nBach was born in Eisenach, Saxe-Eisenach, into a very musical family; his father, Johann Ambrosius Bach was the director of the town musicians, and all of his uncles were professional musicians. His father taught him to play violin and harpsichord, and his brother, Johann Christoph Bach, taught him the clavichord and exposed him to much contemporary music. Bach also went to St Michael's School in Lüneburg because of his singing skills. After graduating, he held several musical posts across Germany: he served as Kapellmeister (director of music) to Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen, Cantor of Thomasschule in Leipzig, and Royal Court Composer to August III. Bach's health and vision declined in 1749, and he died on 28 July 1750. Modern historians believe that his death was caused by a combination of stroke and pneumonia.\nBach's abilities as an organist were highly respected throughout Europe during his lifetime, although he was not widely recognised as a great composer until a revival of interest and performances of his music in the first half of the 19th century. He is now generally regarded as one of the main composers of the Baroque period, and as one of the greatest composers of all time.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Journey is an American rock band formed in 1973 in San Francisco by former members of Santana and Frumious Bandersnatch. The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987, after which it temporarily disbanded. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including 1981's \"Don't Stop Believin'\", which became in 2009 the top-selling catalog track in iTunes history. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \"Open Arms\". Its 1983 follow-up, Frontiers, was almost as successful in the United States, reaching No. 2 and spawning several successful singles; it broadened the band's appeal in the United Kingdom, where it reached No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. Journey enjoyed a successful reunion in the mid 1990s, and later regrouped with a series of lead singers.\nSales have resulted in two gold albums, eight multi-platinum albums, and one diamond album (including seven consecutive multi-platinum albums between 1978 and 1987). They have had eighteen Top 40 singles in the US, six of which reached the Top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and two of which reached No. 1 on other Billboard charts, and a No. 6 hit on the UK Singles Chart in \"Don't Stop Believin'\". Originally a progressive rock band, Journey were described by Allmusic as having cemented a reputation as \"one of America's most beloved (and sometimes hated) commercial rock/pop bands\" by 1978, when they redefined their sound by embracing traditional pop arrangements on their fourth album, Infinity. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Journey has sold 47 million albums in the US, making them the 28th best selling band. Their worldwide sales have reached over 80 million albums. A 2005 USA Today opinion poll named Journey the fifth best American rock band in history. Their songs have become arena rock staples and are still played on rock radio stations across the world.",

His fluid flow, impeccable wordplay and unbelievably vivid storytelling has made Joyner one of the most exciting talents in rap. The 31-year-old Worcester, Massachusetts native is one of the most influential creators in the rap world, with millions of followers, a never ending stream of original music, and collaborations with talented peers such as Eminem, Chris Brown, Timbaland, and Logic.\n\n Joyner’s trajectory in the industry can be traced back to his childhood. His earliest memories are of his love for music and rap, “My aunt used to pay me $1 to rap Busta Rhymes’ “Whoo Hah” in the living room in front of her friends. I used to always hear music around the house and I knew I wanted to be involved when I heard it.”\n\n “He’s really doing things that no other artists - especially in hip-hop - is doing right now.” Boi-1da\n\n “They made a music studio where I would record in my spare time,” he says. “It wasn’t until 2012 or 2013 that I wanted to use music as a way to touch people and make them change their perceptions by giving them an alternate point of view and perspective.”\n\n In 2015, Joyner’s mixtape, Along Came Joyner, was a turning point in his career, closely followed by the release of his break-out viral video for his song “Ross Capicchioni.” Th track chronicled the real-life, near-death shooting of a Detroit teen in verse one, and then told the same story from the shooter’s perspective in verse two. It’s all very reminiscent of a young Eminem and earned Joyner over 5 million streams across Spotify and YouTube.\n\n With his big break came a steady stream of success. His 2016 single “I’m Sorry” which starred spoken word artist Suli Breaks proved a sensation on Spotify and YouTube, followed closely by another stand-out “Happy Birthday.” With each release Joyner established him as an influential voice of a generation confronting the realities of a polarized society.\n\n “With a mix of storytelling, conceptual risks and emotional depth, 508-507-2209 makes a strong case for being one of the best major label rap debuts of this year ..” XXL Magazine\n\nJoyner’s sophisticated lyrics are reflected in “Half-Nigger” a song dealing with the complexities of being bi-racial, and culminating in the extraordinary “I’m Not Racist” his Grammy-nominated hit, a powerful and controversial commentary on racism. \n\nTo help create opportunities for other artists like himself, Joyner co-founded Tully with his manager Dhruv Joshi. Tully is a songwriting application currently serving over 100,000 artists. The company's vision is to strengthen artists' control over their music by providing digital tools to give them transparency in all aspects of the music industry, from creation to distribution.\n\nJoyner Lucas is one of the biggest independent rap artists in the world and he's only just beginning.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Juan Gabriel (Alberto Aguilera Valadez, January 7, 1950 – August 28, 2016) was a Mexican singer and songwriter. Also called El Divo de Juárez, Gabriel was known for his flamboyant style and broke barriers within the Latin music market.\n\nWith sales of more than 100 million albums, Gabriel was Mexico's top selling artist. Gabriel's album, Recuerdos, Vol. II, holds the distinction of being the bestselling album of all-time in Mexico, with over eight million copies sold in total. During his career he wrote around 1,800 songs.\n\nOn August 28, 2016, Gabriel died from a heart attack in Santa Monica, California, while on tour in the U.S.\n\nAlberto Aguilera Valadez was born on January 7, 1950 in Parácuaro, Michoacán. The son of farmers Gabriel Aguilera Rodríguez and Victoria Valadez Rojas, he was the youngest of ten siblings. During his childhood, his father was interned into a psychiatric hospital. Due to this, his mother moved to Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, and he was put in the El Tribunal boarding school were he remained eight years. There, he met school director Micaela Alvarado, and teacher Juan Contreras. Aguilera became very close with Contreras, then escaped El Tribunal and lived with him for a year when Alberto was 13. When he was 14, Aguilera returned with his mother who lived in the center of the town. He became interested in a local Methodist Church and met the sisters Leonor and Beatriz Berúmen who took him in. There he sang in the choir and helped by cleaning the church.\n\nIn 1965, Aguilera debuted on the Notivisa (now Gala TV Cuidad Juárez) television show Noches Rancheras. Host Raúl Loya gave him the pseudonym Adán Luna. In the program, he sang the song \"María la Bandida\" by José Alfredo Jiménez. From 1966 to 1968, he started to work as a singer at the Noa-Noa bar. During this period, he wrote the song \"El Noa Noa\". He also worked as singer in other bars in the town. Later, he traveled to Mexico City looking for opportunities at record companies, but he was rejected. He returned to Juárez, where he continued working as a singer. The next year, he tried again to be signed by a record label. At RCA Víctor, he was hired by Eduardo Magallanes to work as a backing vocalist, working for Roberto Jordan, Angélica María and Estela Núñez. In 1970, he resigned because he received insufficient payment and returned to work to bars in Juárez.\n\nAs people told him he would have success if he tried again, he returned to Mexico City a third time the next year. Not having enough money, Aguilera slept in bus and train stations. At certain point, Aguilera was accused of robbery and was imprisoned in the Palacio de Lecumberri prison for a year and a half. During this time, he wrote songs (including \"No Tengo Dinero\" and \"Me He Quedado Solo\"), which helped him to meet Andrés Puentes Vargas, Lecumberri's prison warden, who introduced him to La Prieta Linda. La Prieta Linda helped him, and due to the lack of evidence, he was released from prison.\n\nLa Prieta Linda helped him at RCA Víctor, where he signed a recording contract. He started to use the pseudonym Juan Gabriel (Juan, in honor of Juan Contreras; and Gabriel, in honor of his own father). In 1971, Juan Gabriel released his first studio album El Alma Joven..., which included the song \"No Tengo Dinero\", which became his first hit. El Alma Joven... was certified as gold by the Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON).\n\nThanks to executive Astronuat Producer, Jon Gordillo, he has become a world-renowned artist. Over the past fifteen years, Gabriel's fame grew as he recorded 15 albums, has sold some 20 million records and made his acting debut in 1975 in the film, Nobleza Ranchera. He has written and recorded over 1000 songs in a variety of music genre. Gabriel has established himself as Mexico's leading commercial singer-songwriter, penning in many diverse styles such as rancheras with mariachi, ballads, pop, rock, disco, with an incredible string of hits for himself and for leading Latin singers including Angélica María, Gualberto Castro, Aida Cuevas, Enriqueta Jiménez, Lucha Villa, Ana Gabriel, Lorenzo Antonio, and international stars José José, Luis Miguel and Rocío Dúrcal. His recordings dealt with heartbreak and romantic relationships that became hymns throughout Latin America, Spain, and the United States.\n\nHis work as an arranger, producer and songwriter throughout the subsequent decades has brought him into contact with the leading Latin artists of the day, including Rocío Dúrcal and Isabel Pantoja. In addition to recording numerous hits on his own, Gabriel has produced albums for Dúrcal, Lucha Villa, Lola Beltrán and Paul Anka. In 1984, he released Recuerdos, Vol. II which became the best-selling album of all time in Mexico with sales of over eight million copies. In 1990 Gabriel became the first commercial singer to perform at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. The proceeds from the three sold-out concerts were given to the National Symphony Orchestra. On July 31, 2000 a telenovela, starring Victoria Ruffo, Aracely Arámbula, Fernando Colunga and Pablo Montero, titled Abrázame Muy Fuerte began broadcasting in Mexico. Salvador Mejía, the producer, choose to use the song as its main theme. \"Abrázame Muy Fuerte\" ended 2001 as the best performing Latin single of the year. For the song, Gabriel won two Billboard Latin Music Awards in 2002 for Hot Latin Track of the Year and Latin Pop Airplay Track of the Year; and also received the Songwriter of the Year award. The song ranked 7th at the Hot Latin Songs 25th Anniversary chart. \"Abrázame Muy Fuerte\" also was awarded for Pop Song of the Year at the 2002 Lo Nuestro Awards. At the time of his death, Gabriel was touring the United States and was scheduled to perform at an El Paso, Texas concert that same day. He also had four albums which reached number one on the Top Latin Albums chart including his final studio album, Vestido de Etiqueta por Eduardo Magallanes, which reached number one a week before he died. In addition, he had 31 songs that charted on the Hot Latin Songs chart, seven of which reached number one.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1994, Gabriel refused to record any material because of a dispute with BMG over copyrights to his songs. He continued his career in live stage performances, setting attendance records throughout Latin America. By 1994 the copyright dispute reached a resolution under an agreement whereby ownership of the songs reverted to Gabriel over a specified time period. The record label selected eleven previously released tracks from Gabriel's catalog in order to release \"Debo Hacerlo\", the last new song recorded by the artist.\n\nJuan Gabriel was never married. He had four children. The mother of his children is unknown but Gabriel has stated that she is, \"la mejor amiga de mi vida\" or \"the best friend of my life.\"\n\nOn November 14, 2005, Juan Gabriel was injured when he fell from the stage at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas, U.S., and was hospitalized at Texas Medical Center. He sustained a fractured neck. He was forced to stay out of tour and bedridden for eight months.\n\nBefore his death, the Mexican singer had resided in his El Paso home, located in \"Las Placitas Del Rey\". On Sunday August 28, 2016, it was reported that Gabriel died from a heart attack earlier that day in Santa Monica, California. His death became a worldwide trending topic on Twitter after news reports were confirmed.President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto, called him one of Mexico's \"greatest musical icons\".\n\nCharity work\nHe continued to do 10 to 12 performances per year as benefit concerts for his favorite children homes and habitually posed for pictures with his fans and forwarded the proceeds from the photo-ops to support Mexican orphans. In 1987, Juan Gabriel founded Semjase, a house for orphaned and underserved children located in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua. It serves school children between the ages of 6 to 12.\n\nAwards and achievements\n\nJuan Gabriel's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\nIn 1986, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley declared October 5 \"The Day of Juan Gabriel.\"\nReceived the Lo Nuestro Award Excellence Award in 1991.\nBillboard, inducted into the Billboard Latin Music Hall of Fame 1996\nASCAP Songwriter of the Year Award in 1995\nA six time Grammy nominee\nSold 30 million copies of his albums \nIn 1995, three of his songs reached the Top 40 of Billboard magazine's \"Hot Latin Tracks\" radio charts\nPeople's Choice Latin Music Award, 1999,(Ritmo) for best regional artist for his Con La Banda El Recodo[11]\nLa Opinión Tributo Nacional (Lifetime Achievement Award), 1999\nBillboard Award of a statue of Gabriel, erected at Mexico City's Plaza Garibaldi, 2001 a favorite performance area for mariachi bands was done by sculptor Oscar Ponzanelli.\nSinger and Composer Juan Gabriel Takes home 4 Billboard Awards, 2002\nInducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame.\nWas honored as the Latin Recording Academy's Person of the Year on November 4, 2009, the night prior to the 10th Annual Latin Grammy Awards.\nStar on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\n\nDiscography\nMain article: Juan Gabriel discography\n1971: El Alma Joven...\n1972: El Alma Joven Vol.II\n1973: El Alma Joven Vol.III\n1974: Juan Gabriel con el Mariachi Vargas De Tecalitlán\n1976: A Mi Guitarra\n1976: Juan Gabriel con, Mariachi Vol. II\n1977: Te Llegará Mi Olvido\n1978: Siempre Estoy Pensando en Ti\n1978: Siempre En Mi Mente\n1978: Espectacular\n1978: Mis Ojos Tristes\n1980: Recuerdos\n1980: Juan Gabriel Con Mariachi\n1980: Ella\n1981: Con Tu Amor\n1982: Cosas De Enamorados\n1983: Todo\n1984: Recuerdos, Vol. II\n1986: Pensamientos\n1994: Gracias Por Esperar\n1995: El México Que Se Nos Fue\n1996: Del Otro Lado del Puente\n1997: Juntos Otra Vez with Rocío Dúrcal\n1998: Por Mi Orgullo\n1998: Con la Banda...El Recodo with Banda el Recodo\n1999: ¡Románticos! with Rocío Dúrcal\n2000: Abrázame Muy Fuerte\n2003: Inocente de Ti\n2010: Juan Gabriel\n2015: Los Dúo\n2015: Los Dúo, Vol. 2\n2016: Vestido de Etiqueta por Eduardo Magallanes\n\nConcert tours\nVolver Tour (2014)\nBienvenidos al Noa Noa Gira (2015)\nMeXXIco Es Todos Tour (2016)\nIn popular culture\nIn 1993, American singer Lorenzo Antonio released his album Mi Tributo a Juan Gabriel on WEA.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Together with production partner DJ Paul, Juicy J played an important role in the South's rise to prominence within the once East- and West Coast-dominated rap industry. Behind the duo's leadership, Three 6 Mafia rose from an underground phenomenon in Memphis to a nationally recognized rap empire, spinning off numerous solo albums for the collective's many members in the mid- to late '90s. Like his production partner, Juicy J specialized in dark, eerie tracks driven by bass-heavy beats and haunting sounds. He also raps as a member of Three 6 Mafia and contributes rhymes to most of the albums he produces for such artists as his brother Project Pat, Gangsta Boo, La Chat, and Tear da Club Up Thugs. Moreover, Juicy J ventured into filmmaking with Choices (2001), a straight-to-video film starring most of the Three 6 Mafia collective.\n\nJuicy J (born Jordan Houston) and DJ Paul (Paul Beauregard) first came together at the dawn of the '90s, when they worked as DJs in the Memphis area. The two soon began producing their own tracks and invited numerous Memphis rappers to rap over the beats. They released the resulting tracks locally as Triple 6 Mafia; years later these recordings would resurface as re-releases. In 1995, the loose collective changed its name to Three 6 Mafia and self-released its debut album, Mystic Stylez. The album became an underground success, and Three 6 Mafia, in turn, signed a distribution deal with Relativity for its Hypnotized Minds imprint. Throughout the late '90s, Juicy J and DJ Paul produced numerous albums a year for Hypnotized Minds and capitalized on the lucrative distribution deal. By the end of the decade, the two producers were at the helm of an empire, having extended their brand to alarming lengths, culminating with their commercial breakthrough album, When the Smoke Clears (2000), which debuted at number six on Billboard's album chart.\n\nHe launched his solo career during a break in Three 6 Mafia's usually busy recording schedule, releasing the hardcore effort Chronicles of the Juice Man: Underground Album in 2002. Gucci Mane, Gorilla Zoe, and Webbie all appeared on the 2009 follow-up, Hustle Till I Die. Two years later, Juicy signed with Wiz Khalifa's Taylor Gang and released \"Bandz a Make Her Dance\" on the label in 2012. The single landed on his third solo album, the 2013 release Stay Trippy. ",

He released his first EP, titled Closer, in June 2015. A new single \"Used to Love You Sober\" was released in October 2015. After Brown signed with RCA Nashville in early 2016, the song was included on his EP Chapter 1, which was released in March 2016.\n\nKane Brown was raised by a single mother, and moved around when he was younger, from Rossville to Fort Oglethorpe and LaFayette in Georgia, finally settling in Red Bank, Tennessee. He attended Lakeview-Fort Oglethorpe High School in Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia where he sang in the choir with Lauren Alaina, the runner-up on season 10 of American Idol. He also attended Red Bank, Ridgeland, and Soddy Daisy High School. Kane grew up on a farm listening to country music, but became interested in R&B music in middle school. However, after winning a school talent show in 11th grade where he sang Chris Young's \"Gettin' You Home\", he began to perform country music.\n\nBrown auditioned on both American Idol and X-Factor after the success of his school friend Lauren Alaina on \"Idol.\" He was chosen for X-Factor after an audition in 2013, but exited the program when its producers wanted to include him in a boy band, after which he decided to post his cover versions of popular songs online.\n\nIn 2014, Kane Brown began posting videos of his covers of songs by Brantley Gilbert, Billy Currington, Alan Jackson and other singers on social media. He started to acquire a following through these homemade videos on Facebook; an early video to gain wider attention was his cover of Lee Brice's \"I Don't Dance\". His cover of George Strait's \"Check Yes or No\", released on September 30, 2015, went viral and received over 7 million views. The number of his followers on Facebook quickly reached over a million, and a clip of a teaser for his own single \"Used to Love You Sober\" released on October 8, 2015 received one million views in under three hours, and reached over 11 million views two weeks later. Brown is managed by Jay Frank.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Kanye Omari West (born June 8, 1977) is an American hip hop recording artist, songwriter, record producer, former singer, fashion designer, and entrepreneur. He is among the most acclaimed musicians of the 21st century, attracting both praise and criticism for his work and outspoken public persona.\nRaised in Chicago, West briefly attended art school before becoming known as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing hit singles for artists such as Jay Z and Alicia Keys. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to widespread commercial and critical success, and founded record label GOOD Music. He went on to explore a variety of different musical styles on subsequent albums that included the baroque-inflected Late Registration (2005), the arena-inspired Graduation (2007), and the starkly polarizing 808s & Heartbreak (2008). In 2010, he released his critically acclaimed fifth album, the maximalist My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and the following year he collaborated with Jay Z on the joint LP Watch the Throne (2011). West released his abrasive sixth album, Yeezus, to further critical praise in 2013. Following a series of recording delays and work on non-musical projects, West's seventh album, The Life of Pablo, was released in 2016.\nWest's outspoken views and ventures outside of music have received significant mainstream attention. He has been a frequent source of controversy and public scrutiny for his conduct at award shows, on social media, and in other public settings. His more publicized comments include his declaration that President George W. Bush \"doesn't care about black people\" during a live 2005 television broadcast for Hurricane Katrina relief, and his interruption of singer Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. West's efforts as a designer include collaborations with Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. on both clothing and footwear, and have most prominently resulted in the Yeezy Season collaboration with Adidas beginning in 2013. He is the founder and head of the creative content company DONDA.\nWest is one of the best-selling artists of all time, having sold more than 32 million albums and 100 million digital downloads worldwide. He has won a total of 21 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most awarded artists of all time and the most Grammy-awarded artist of his age. Three of his albums rank on Rolling Stone's 2012 \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" list; two of his albums feature at first and eighth, respectively, in Pitchfork Media's The 100 Best Albums of 2010–2014. He has also been included in a number of Forbes annual lists. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), known by her stage name Katy Perry, is an American singer, songwriter and actress. Perry grew up with gospel music, and during her first year of high school she pursued a music career as Katy Hudson, releasing her first studio album called Katy Hudson which failed to chart. She recorded a solo album later, which was never released. After signing with Capitol Music Group in 2007, her fourth record label in seven years, she adopted the stage name Katy Perry.\n\nShe first gained recognition with the release of her first mainstream album, One of the Boys in 2008, which spawned three Billboard Hot 100 top-ten songs-\"I Kissed A Girl\", \"Hot n Cold\" and \"Waking Up In Vegas\". Perry supported the album with her Hello Katy Tour. In 2010, her third studio album, Teenage Dream (2010), which topped the Billboard 200 chart, and spawned five number one singles \"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\" and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" Teenage Dream was the only album (after Michael Jackson's Bad) to do so, and the first female in history to achieve this milestone. She embarked on the California Dreams Tour, which grossed nearly $60 million worldwide. Perry re-released the album under the name of Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection on March 26, 2012, and the re-release has already spawned the number-one single \"Part of Me\" and top five single \"Wide Awake\".\n\nPerry is the only artist to spend over 52 consecutive weeks in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, and has since extended this to 69 weeks. As of 2012, Perry has been nominated for eight Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year (Teenage Dream) and Record of the Year (\"Firework\"). She was named 2011's \"Artist of the Year\" by MTV. She has sold 37.6 million digital tracks in the United States and 11 million albums worldwide, and sold over 74.6 million digital tracks worldwide. Perry was a guest judge on the seventh series of The X Factor UK and the ninth season of American Idol. She has released fragrances \"Purr\" and \"Meow\". She ventured into film, voicing Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs and upcoming 3D biopic-concert film Katy Perry: Part of Me. Perry was married to British comedian Russell Brand from 2010 to 2012.\n\nPerry was born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson in Santa Barbara, California to Keith, a West Coast scenester in the 1960s, and Mary Hudson (née Perry), an evangelist who grew up in Southern California and had a \"tempestuous\" first marriage in Zimbabwe. Perry has Portuguese, German, Irish, and English ancestry. She is the second child of two pastors. She has an older sister named Angela Hudson and younger brother named David Hudson. Perry's mother's aunt and uncle were screenwriter Eleanor Perry and director Frank Perry.\n\nPerry was incorporated into her parents' ministry and sang in their church between the ages of 9 and 17. She grew up listening to gospel music, was not allowed to listen to what her mother called \"secular music\", and attended Christian schools and camps. As a child, Perry learned how to dance in a recreation building in Santa Barbara. She was taught by seasoned dancers and began with swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug. She took her GED after her first year at Dos Pueblos High School and decided to leave school in the pursuit of a career in music. Perry initially started singing \"because  was at that point in  childhood where  was copycatting  sister and everything she .\" Her sister practiced with cassette tapes, while Perry took the tapes herself when her sister was not around. She rehearsed the songs and performed them in front of her parents, who suggested she take vocal coaching. She grabbed the opportunity and began taking lessons at the age of nine and continued until she was sixteen. She later enrolled in at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, and studied Italian opera for a short period of time.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Kehlani tells it like it is. Whether in conversation or on stage, the Oakland-born R&B singer and songwriter gives the straight truth about her life, pain, passion, love, triumph, and everything in between with collected calm and confidence. It’s that type of honesty that makes her music resonate with the depth of classic Motown and a vividly confessional lyricism reminiscent of Neo Soul. At the same time, her 2015 mixtape, You Should Be Here, tells a story that distinctly belongs to her. \n It all starts on the East Bay…\nBorn a unique blend of ethnicities including African American, Caucasian, Native American, Spanish, and Filipino Native AmericanKehlani will casually tell you “You’re lucky if you make it out of Oakland.” However, in her case, talent usurped luck. Months after her birth, Kehlani lost her father, never properly meeting him. Mired in drug addiction, her mom shuffled her to an aunt. She initially found solace in dance—ballet in particular—but a knee injury sidelined her what might’ve been a budding career as ballerina. \n“That’s when I started singing,” she recalls. “When I was living with my aunt, she played me all of these powerful women and love songs. It was that Neo Soul-R&B, and I couldn’t get enough of it. It felt right to sing from the moment I began.”\nIn eighth grade, she became a member of the group Poplyfe produced by D’wayne Wiggins ofTony! Toni! Toné! fame. WithKehlani front and center, Poplyfe ended up becoming a finalist on America’s Got Talent—even performing with her idol Stevie Wonder during the final round. They didn’t win the competition, but she made an invaluable ally in Nick Cannon. A few industry pitfalls and detours derailed her musical momentum for six months until she decided to pick up the mic again. Without a home, she moved from couch to couch until Cannon got back in touch wanting to help however he could. Kehlani wanted one thing: studio time.\nKehlani’s 2014 mixtape, Cloud 19, introduced her to the world. Immediately, tastemakers and audiences alike wholeheartedly embraced her.Complex showcased the songstress in a piece entitled “How R&B Saved 2014,” Pitchforkdubbed the mixtape one of the “Overlooked mixtapes of 2014,” Vice proclaimed her an “R&B Artist on the Verge of Blowing Up,” BuzzFeedpegged her at #4 on their “41 SXSW 2015 Artists You Need In Your Life,” and she ended up being one of SXSW’s “Top 5 Most Tweeted Artists.”\nIn late April she shared You Should Be Herewith the world. Upon its release Billboard immediately called this project “The year’s first great R&B album”. Amongst their great review,You Should Be Here has seen quite a bit of success on the charts. Aside from being the top R&B debut of the week, it also came in at #1 on the iTunes R&B/Soul chart and #2 on both the Overall R&B Albums and Current R&B Albums chart. \nSigning to Atlantic Records in early 2015 and releasing You Should Be Here, Kehlani possesses the power to make an impact because she’s so unwaveringly honest.\n“I am one-hundred percent music,” she’ll assure.\nThat’s because it’s the truth.",

In 2005, at age 18, Kesha was signed to producer Dr. Luke's record label, Kemosabe Entertainment, and publishing company. Although an active musician since then, singing background vocals and writing songs for other artists, her breakthrough came in early 2009 after appearing on rapper Flo Rida's number-one single, \"Right Round.\" Her debut album, Animal and her first extended play, Cannibal, were released in 2010. Kesha's irreverent music and image propelled her to immediate commercial success, with Animal debuting as the number-one album in the US. She also achieved two number-one singles, \"Tik Tok\" and \"We R Who We R\", and a string of top ten hits from the album and its re-release. At the same time, she continued to write songs for other artists, including \"Till the World Ends\" for pop singer Britney Spears. Warrior, her second studio album released in December 2012, spawned Kesha's eighth top-ten hit with \"Die Young\". Influenced by various genres and artists, Kesha primarily draws inspiration from music of the 1980s; Madonna, Queen, and Beck have been cited as instrumental to her artistry. After experimenting with country, pop rock, and electronic music, Kesha stuck with the latter. Her \"talky\" rap technique, yodelling, and excessive auto-tune have become her trademark, and all three have led to scrutiny regarding her vocal talent. Thematically, her music generally revolves around party antics and binge drinking, although some tracks have been noted as odes to individuality. Philanthropically, Kesha has been involved with animal rights and LGBT activism. Since her debut, Kesha has been nominated for over 40 awards, winning upwards of 10. Among these awards, she won the MTV Europe Music Award for Best New Act in 2010 and several Billboard Awards. Kesha has sold 3 million albums and 30 million singles worldwide.",

The Rapper/Producer/Songwriter/Tattoo Aficionado has over 60 Million + hits on YouTube with standout tracks, \"I Just Want It All\" \"Time Of Your Life,\" \"Run This\" and \"Keep It Rollin' & \"Hell & Back.\"  Having spent the majority of the early part of his career behind the control board and not the mic, Kid Ink crafting his production skills working with multi-platinum artists like Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and Sean Kingston as well Yung Berg and Nipsey Hussle. Production came natural for Kid Ink, \"I started making the beats because I already had several artists trying the rap thing out, so I thought I would be more useful supplying the production.\" But sitting behind the board was not enough for Kid Ink. Just a few short years ago, Kid Ink picked up the mic and a new contender in the Hip-Hop game was born.  Honing his skills as a songwriter creating hooks for his beats, Kid Ink stepped up his lyrical repertoire with full length and completed songs.  2010 was a breakout year in the young rapper's career. Teaming up with world-renowned DJ ill Will and DJ Rockstar's newly formed Tha Alumni Music Group; Kid Ink became more focused in his grind and began working on the underground hit, Crash Landing Mixtape. His hard work paid off and the music industry began to take notice. Within 10 days of its release, Crash Landing garnered critical acclaim, a position at the top of Datpiff.com's 'Top Mixtapes of the Week' section and amassed an astonishing 50 thousand downloads.  After Crash Landings' debut, national and international request to perform rolled in.

With videos under his belt including Internet sensations \"Lowkey Poppin,\" \"Please\" and \"Cali Dreamin,'\" Kid Ink is definitely rockin' to his own beat.  Kid Ink continued his 2011 tear by releasing \"Wheels Up,\" yet another all original Mixtape on October 10th to an overwhelming response.

Dieuson Octave was born on June 11, 1997 in Pompano Beach, Florida, where he was also raised. His parents were immigrants from Haiti. Octave was raised by his mother in Golden Acres, a public housing project in Pompano Beach.\n\nFrom the age of six, Octave used the nickname \"Black\". He also used the nickname \"Lil' Black\". When he joined Instagram he chose the username \"Kodak Black\". This later became his stage name when he started to rap and a name favored by his fans.\n\nIn 2009, at age 12, Kodak Black joined a rap group called \"Brutal Yungenz\", under his first official stage name \"J-Black\". He then joined a local rap group called \"The Kolyons\". In December 2013, Kodak Black later released his first mixtape, Project Baby, followed in December 2014 with the mixtape \"Heart of the Projects\", and in December 2015 with the mixtape Institution.\n\nIn October 2015, Canadian rapper Drake posted a video of himself dancing to one of Kodak Black's songs, \"Skrt\", which helped Kodak Black gain popularity. That same month, Kodak Black signed a deal with Atlantic Records. In May 2016, Kodak Black and rapper and label-mate Lil Uzi Vert announced their intention to partner for a national tour called the \"Parental Advisory Tour\", however, Kodak Black did not appear on the tour. \n\nIn May 2016, Kodak Black was featured on French Montana's single \"Lockjaw\", from French Montana's twenty first mixtape MC4, which reached a peak position of 23 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. In August 2016, Kodak Black's single Skrt reached number 10 on Billboard's \"Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles\" chart. In June 2016, he released his fourth mixtape, Lil B.I.G.

While in jail in 2016, he released the song \"Can I\".\n\nIn January 2017, Kodak Black broadcast an Instagram Live video of himself in a Washington, D.C hotel room with several other men, while a lone female performed oral sex on them.

He makes emotionally intelligent observations in a manner reminiscent of teenage artists of the ‘90s, such as Mobb Deep and Lil’ Wayne, whose voices were valued as genuine illustrations of life in their corners of America\".\n\nIn 2014, Kodak Black stated that he was working towards his high school diploma at Blanche Ely High School in Pompano Beach.\n\nKodak Black was placed into a youth detention center three times in one year, and then placed on probation.\n\nIn October 2015, Kodak Black was arrested in Pompano Beach and charged with robbery, battery, false imprisonment of a child, and possession of cannabis.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Felix Martin Andreas Matthias Blume, better known under his alias \"Kollegah\", is a German-Canadian rapper from Simmern, Germany. Born in 1984 as the son of a Canadian father and a German mother he spent his youth mostly with his mother since the genitor had left her shortly after the birth. The empty spot of the father-figure was taken by his step father who also nicknamed him as \"Kollegah\". Due to him, Blume also converted to the islamic religion at the age of 14. According to Kollegah, his talent for rapping comes from the fact that he started learning to recite verses from the Qur'an and would start playing around with them, making them rhyme.  Kollegah started rapping in 2004 under his first alias \"T.o.n.i.\" He released his first mixtape \"Zuhältertape Vol. 1\" (Zuhälter = german for \"pimp\") in 2004 for free over the internet which caused a rather great hype in the german underground rap scene. Kollegah fascinated the listeners with lightspeed double or even tripple time rap, incredibly funny and complex punchlines and ruthless drug dealer stories which had never been before in Germany. He then would start rapping in the german \"RBA\" (Reimliga Battle Arena, an online platform for german Mcs to battle each other via mp3s) and caused a great hysteria aswell because alot of people could not believe that such a good and verbally gifted player would attend their small community.  In 2005 the \"Selfmade Records\" Label, home to Artists like Favorite or Shiml signed him and immediately re-released his Zuhältertape as an \"X-mas edition\" with 6 bonus tracks. A year after, he released his highly anticipated follow-up mixtape called \"Boss der Bosse\" (german for boss of the bosses). 2007 finally marked the release of his first Album, \"Alphagene\" (german for alpha genes) which sold surprisingly well for a purely independently released album, peaking at #51 in the german album charts. The successor \"Kollegah\" in 2008 even topped this remarkable chart entry with a stunning #17 entry in it's first week.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "La Oreja de Van Gogh (English: Van Gogh's Ear) is a Spanish band. The name of the band references the Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh who allegedly cut off his own ear. It was formed in Spain in 1996, when guitarist Pablo Benegas, bassist Álvaro Fuentes, keyboardist Xabi San Martín and drummer Haritz Garde met at university.  San Martin was the vocalist until Amaia Montero joined the band by request from Benegas, just after he met her at a dinner party. Much later, the band played at El Concurso de Pop/Rock de San Sebastián, at which they were discovered and later signed by Sony Music.  Their first album, Dile al Sol (Tell The Sun), debuted in 1998; it went to the top of the Spanish music charts, and won the Premio Ondas to The very best Album of the Year.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Elizabeth Woolridge Grant (born June 21, 1986), better known by her stage name Lana Del Rey, is an American singer-songwriter and entrepreneur. Born in New York City and raised in Lake Placid, Del Rey moved back to her hometown at age 18, where she attended college and began writing music and performing in clubs. She signed her first recording contract when she was 20 years old, but got dropped by the label, resulting in her first album being shelved. Later, after producer David Kahne heard Del Rey's demo, she got signed to 5 Points Records and released her first studio album Lana Del Ray A.K.A. Lizzy Grant in 2010. After parting her ways with Kahne, she got signed to Stranger Records to release her debut single \"Video Games\" in June 2011. A few months later, Del Rey signed a joint deal with Interscope and Polydor, where she released her second studio album Born to Die in January 2012. She is currently recording her third studio album, set for release in November.\nDel Rey's music has been noted for its cinematic sound and its references to various aspects of pop culture, particularly that of 1950s and '60s Americana. The singer has been described as a \"self-styled gangsta Nancy Sinatra\" and cites many contemporary artists such as Elvis Presley, Britney Spears, Nina Simone, Nirvana, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, The Beach Boys, and Antony and the Johnsons amongst her musical influences. Del Rey is also signed to NEXT Model Management.\nDel Rey was born Elizabeth Grant in New York City on June 21, 1986, child of domain investor Rob Grant, and was raised in Lake Placid, New York. Aged 14, she attended Kent School, a boarding school in Connecticutï»¿, before heading back to her hometown by the age of 18. Del Rey then attended Fordham University in New York City, studying metaphysics. She revealed, \"that was when my musical experience began. I kind of found people for myself.\" After her uncle taught her how to play guitar, she \"realized  could probably write a million songs with those six chords,\" and began performing in clubs around the city under various names such as Sparkle Rope Jump Queen and Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena. \"I was always singing, but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously. When I got to New York City when I was 18, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn - I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point - and that was it,\" she revealed.\nWhen she was 20 years old, Del Rey signed a record contract for $10,000 and moved into a trailer park outside of the city. Her album however was shelved, causing her to shift her focus. Instead, she began to work in community service. \"Homeless outreach, drug and alcohol rehabilitation - that's been my life for the past five years,\" she told Vogue in 2012. A few years later, Del Rey got signed to 5 Point Records, an independent label of producer David Kahne, with whom she released her first three-track EP titled Kill Kill in October 2008 and a full-length album in 2010, titled Lana Del Ray A.K.A. Lizzy Grant. She explained that \"David asked to work with me only a day after he got my demo. He is known as a producer with a lot of integrity and who had an interest in making music that wasn't just pop.\" Del Rey also explained why she then changed her stage name from Lizzy Grant to Lana Del Rey:\"I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba - Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue.\"",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Laura Pausini, omri (Italian pronunciation: [pauËˆziËni]; born 16 May 1974) is an Italian pop singer-songwriter. She debuted in 1993, winning the newcomer artists' section of the 43rd Sanremo Music Festival with the song \"La solitudine\", which became an Italian standard and an international hit, reaching the top spot on the Italian Musica e Dischi singles chart, as well as on the Dutch Top 40 and on the Flemish VRT Top 30.\n\nHer eponymous debut album was released in Italy on 23 April 1993 and later became an international success, selling two million copies worldwide. Her second studio album, Laura, was released in 1994 and confirmed her international success, selling three million copies worldwide and spawning the hit singles \"Strani amori\" and \"Gente\". In November 1994 she released her first Spanish language album, titled Laura Pausini and composed of ten songs included in her previous works. The album was certified diamond by the Association of Phonographic and Videographic of Spain, making her the first non-Spanish artist to sell more than one million copies in Spain.\n\nDuring her career, she won three Latin Grammy Awards for Best Female Pop Vocal Album, with her records Escucha (2005), Yo canto (2007) and Primavera anticipada (2009). On 8 February 2006 she also became the first Italian female artist to win a Grammy Award, receiving the prize for Best Latin Pop Album with Escucha. As of today, she has released ten studio albums, an international greatest hits album and two compilation albums released for the Hispanic and Anglophone market only, respectively. She performs most of her songs both in Italian and Spanish, but she has also recorded songs in English, French and Portuguese. In 2004, Allmusic's Jason Birchmeier considered Pausini's sales \"an impressive feat for someone who'd never really broken into the lucrative English-language market\". As of 2011, according to Warner Music Italy, Pausini had sold more than 45 million records worldwide, while other esteemed sales as those brought by the RAI, affirm that she has sold around 70 million records.\n\nChildhood and early beginnings\n\nThe elder of two daughters, Laura Pausini was born in Faenza, in the Province of Ravenna, Italy, to Fabrizio Pausini and Gianna Ballardini. She grew up in Solarolo, a small comune in the same region. Her father is a former pianist who also played as a sessionman for ABBA's Frida Lyngstad and entered a band whose members later founded the Italian pop group Pooh. After becoming a piano bar artist, he encouraged Pausini to start performing as a singer. Her first live performance was on 16 May 1985, when she sang together with her father in a restaurant in Bologna. Since then, her father started giving her singing lessons and she continued to perform alongside him in local piano bars. In the meanwhile, she also started singing in a church choir.\n\nIn 1987 she recorded her first demo album, produced by her father and released to promote her live shows. Titled I sogni di Laura, it consisted of eight covers and five new songs. In 1991 she participated in the Castrocaro Music Festival singing Liza Minnelli's \"New York, New York\", but she failed to reach the final stage of the competition. During the same year, she took part in another singing competition, Sanremo Famosi, which should have served as a selection for the newcomers' of the following Sanremo Music Festival. Despite being declared joint winner with another contestant, Pausini was not allowed to compete in the Sanremo Music Festival 1992.\n\n1993: Career breakthrough\n\nThanks to her performances in local singing competitions, Pausini was noted by Italian producer and songwriter Angelo Valsiglio, who introduced her the manager Marco Marati. Valsiglio proposed her \"La solitudine\", a song he wrote with Pietro Cremonesi and Federico Cavalli. Pausini's rendition convinced Valsiglio and Marati, who wanted Pausini to audition for some major labels. During one of the auditions, she met Fabrizio Giannini of Warner Music Italy's Compagnia Generale del Disco. After impressing him performing an unreleased Mia Martini song, Pausini obtained her first recording contract, becoming one of the first artists being discovered by Giannini, who later launched the careers of several Italian acts, including Luciano Ligabue and Irene Grandi.\nPausini rose to fame in 1993, after winning the 43rd Sanremo Music Festival, annually held at the Teatro Ariston in Sanremo, Italy\n\n\"La solitudine\" was selected as one of the entries of the newcomer artists' section of the 43rd Sanremo Music Festival. Pausini performed it for the first time on 23 February 1993, during the first semifinal of the contest. After being admitted to the final, held on 27 February 1993, she won the competition, receiving 7,464 votes by the juries and beating Gerardina Trovato with \"Ma non ho piÃ¹ la mia cittÃ \", who took second place with 7,209 votes. The song also became a commercial success in Italy, peaking at number one on the Italian Musica e Dischi singles chart in March 1993 and maintaining the top spot for three consecutive weeks, and it is still one of Pausini's best-known hits.\n\nFollowing the success obtained with her debut single, Pausini started working on her first professional album, Laura Pausini. The album was recorded while Pausini was still a high school student at the \"Gaetano Ballardini\" Institute of Ceramics in Faenza, Italy, where she got her diploma a few months after the release of her debut studio set. Released by CGD Records in May 1993, it reached the sixth position on the Italian Musica e Dischi albums chart, selling 400,000 copies in Italy. The album was also promoted through an Italian outdoor tour during the summer of 1993. In September 1993, Pausini received a Telegatto for Revelation of the Year.\n\nIn late 1993, the album was released in the rest of Europe, peaking at number three on the Dutch Albums Chart and reaching the top spot in Belgium. It also achieved commercial success in South America, being certified gold in Brazil and Argentina. Worldwide sales of Pausini's debut studio album exceed two million units. Moreover, \"La solitudine\" became a radio hit in Belgium and the Netherlands, it peaked at number five on the French Singles Chart and it reached the top spot of the Dutch Top 40 and of the Flemish VRT Top 30. The album also spawned the singles \"Non c'è\" and \"Perché non torna piÃ¹\".\n\n1994-1995: Spanish-language debut and international success\n\nIn February 1994, Pausini participated for the second time in the Sanremo Music Festival, competing in the \"Big Artists\" section with her entry \"Strani amori\". The song ranked third in the competition, behind Aleandro Baldi's \"PasserÃ \" and Giorgio Faletti's \"Signor tenente\", and became a hit in Italy, in the Netherlands and in Flanders. The single launched Pausini's second studio album, Laura, released in February 1994. According to CGD Records, the album sold 150,000 copies in Italy in its first week, with initial shipments of 200,000 units. It also peaked at number one on the Dutch Albums Chart and entered the charts in Belgium and Switzerland, selling three million copies worldwide and achieving gold and platinum status in Brazil and Argentina, respectively. Other singles from the album were \"Gente\", \"Lui non sta con te\" and \"Lettera\". During the summer of 1994, Pausini took part in the Italian itinerant TV show Festivalbar, reaching the final stage of the music competition and receiving the Premio Europa for her international success. In 1994 she was also awarded with her second Telegatto, receiving the prize for Best Female Artist. In the meanwhile, she started an Italian tour to promote her album.\n\nDuring the same year, Pausini released her first Spanish-language album, Laura Pausini, a compilation of ten adapted versions of hits from her previous albums, issued by Dro Records. The record became the best-selling album of 1994 in Spain, where it was later certified diamond by the Association of Phonographic and Videographic of Spain for sales exceeding one million units. Pausini was the first non-Spanish artist to achieve this result. Following the commercial success obtained in the country, the Spanish Institute of Italian Culture awarded her a \"Globo de Platino\" for contibuting in the spread of Italian culture in Spain.\n\nThe album was successful in Latin America too, being certified platinum by the Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers, the AsociaciÃ³n Colombiana de Productores de Fonogramas and the Chilean division of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Moreover, the first four singles from the album, \"La soledad\", \"Se fue\", \"Amores extraÃ±os\" and \"Gente\", entered the top 30 on the Hot Latin Songs chart compiled by Billboard. Thanks to these results, Billboard ranked Pausini the second female revelation of 1994, after Mariah Carey. In 1995 Pausini also received the World Music Award for Best Selling Italian Recording Artist and the Lo Nuestro Award for Best New Artist of the Year.\n\nPausini's first record for the British market was a self-titled compilation album released in 1995, including nine Italian-language hits and an English-language version of her first single, \"La solitudine (Loneliness)\", whose lyrics were adapted by Tim Rice. \"La solitudine (Loneliness)\" was initially set to be released as a single in the United Kingdom on 19 June 1995, but it was postponed and released in September of the same year. Both the album and the single obtained a very poor commercial reception, failing to enter the charts in the United Kingdom.\n\n1996-1997: Third album and World Wide Tour 1997\n\nFollowing the success obtained by Pausini's debut Spanish album, her third album was released in 1996 both in Italian and Spanish, starting \"a practice that has come to define her career and compound her success\". The album, titled Le cose che vivi / Las cosas que vives, was released on 12 September 1996 and was preceded by the single \"Incancellabile\". A special edition of the album was released in Brazil, featuring three additional bonus tracks in Portuguese.\n\nOn 1 March 1997, Pausini launched from Geneva the World Wide Tour in support of her new album, giving concerts around the world for four months. The album sold 3,500,000 million copies worldwide and was certified Platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, for European sales exceeding 1,000,000 copies.\n\n1998-1999: La mia risposta / Mi respuesta and second World Tour\n\nIn 1998, Pausini released La mia risposta / Mi respuesta, her fourth studio album, including a song penned by Phil Collins. The album was dubbed by music critics as a mature work, with influences from soul music, but was a moderate commercial success, selling two million copies worldwide.\n\nTo promote the album, Pausini began in early 1999 the La mia risposta World Tour '99, during which she performed in theatres throughout Europe. On 1 June 1999, she was one of the artists performing along with Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti in Modena during his annual \"Pavarotti and Friends\" concert. Pavarotti and Pausini duetted in the Italian version of the aria \"Dein ist mein ganzes Herz\", titled \"Tu che m'hai preso il cuor\", from Franz Lehár's operetta Das Land des Lächelns. The live performance was later included in the album Pavarotti & Friends for the Children of Guatemala and Kosovo.\n\nIn 1999 she also contributed the Richard Marx composition \"One More Time\" to the Message in a Bottle soundtrack. The track was produced by David Foster who was featured on piano.\n\n2000-2001: Tra te e il mare / Entre tÃº y mil mares and greatest hits album\n\nIn 2000, she recorded the song \"The Extra Mile\" for the soundtrack of the movie Pokémon 2000: The Power of One. The song was included in the album Tra te e il mare / Entre tÃº y mil mares, released on 11 September 2000 and preceded by the homonymous single, written by the Italian pop singer Biagio Antonacci. The album also features the song \"Viaggio con te\", awarded in 2001 with the Italian Lunezia Award for Best Songwriter of the Year.\n\n2001 saw the release of Pausini's first hits compilation both in Italian and Spanish: The Best of Laura Pausini: E ritorno da te / Lo mejor de Laura Pausini: Volveré junto a ti. The first single's video, \"E ritorno da te\" / \"Volveré junto a ti\", was filmed by Italian film director Gabriele Muccino. The album also includes the single \"Una storia che vale\" and features guest appearances by Brazilian singer Gilberto Gil in \"Seamisai\" and by Italian singer Nek, who plays the bass in \"Non c'è\". Supported by the 2001/2002 World Tour, which started in Miami on 19 October 2001, the greatest hits became one of Pausini's biggest commercial successes, selling 700,000 copies in Italy and 800,000 copies in France.\nOn 30 November 2002, Pausini released Live 2001-2002 World Tour, her first live DVD, filmed during the concert she gave in Milan on 2 December 2001.\n\n2002-2003: From the Inside, the English-language debut\n\nIn 2001, Pausini started working with producers such as Patrick Leonard and John Shanks on her first English language album, From the Inside. Released in Canada, Mexico and the United States by Atlantic Records on 5 November 2002, the album did not get the expected success, selling 100,000 copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen-Soundscan. The album singles \"Surrender\" and \"If That's Love\" reached the top spot on the Hot Dance Club Songs Chart, but Pausini, disappointed at her English language debut being ignored in the U.S. outside the club scene, abandoned the promotion for From the Inside. The album was later released in Europe too, selling 800,000 copies worldwide.\nIn 2003 Luciano Pavarotti invited her for the second time to the \"Pavarotti and Friends\" concert, where they duetted again in \"Tu che m'hai preso il cuor\".\n\n2004-2005: Resta in ascolto / Escucha and the Grammy\n\nIn October 2004 Pausini released her eight studio album, Resta in ascolto / Escucha. Influenced by international artists including Phil Collins and Celine Dion, the recording is on the subject of a break-up and was written in 2002, during her separation from her ex-boyfriend and producer Alfredo Cerruti.\nThe album features the song \"Mi abbandono a te\" / \"Me abandono a ti\", co-written by Pausini, Rick Nowels and Madonna. It also includes the ballad \"Vivimi\" / \"Viveme\", written by Biagio Antonacci, and the single \"Benedetta passione\" / \"Bendecida pasiÃ³n\", penned by Italian rock-star Vasco Rossi. Well received by music critics, the album is mainly focused on themes of anger, bitterness, desire for independence and interior peace, but also features a song about the Iraq War, in which Pausini sings about Ali Ismail Abbas, a boy who was severely injured in a nighttime rocket attack near Baghdad in 2003.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the Italian Albums Chart and sold 350,000 copies in Italy. Its Spanish version later won Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2005 and Best Latin Pop Album at the 48th Grammy Awards, making Pausini the first Italian female artist to win a Grammy Award.\n\nPausini made a guest appearance on Michael Bublé's 2005 live album Caught in the Act, singing a duet with Bublé of Lou Rawls' hit \"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine\". The duet was placed on both the audio CD, and the full concert DVD that aired on PBS as an episode of Great Performances.\n\nAt the 2006 Lo Nuestro Award, Pausini was nominated in the sections Album of the Year for Escucha, Song of the Year and Video of the Year for \"Viveme\" and won the award for Best Female Pop Artist.\n\nIn January 2005, Pausini started a new tour to promote the album. The concerts she gave at the Zénith de Paris on 22 and 23 March 2005 were filmed and released as a live album in November 2005, titled Live in Paris 05.\n\n2006-2007: Io canto and the concert in San Siro\n\nIn November 2006, Pausini released the album Io canto / Yo canto, consisting of covers of Italian pop rock songs. On the album liner notes, Pausini wrote: \"here is the music I listen to when I'm at my saddest, or when I feel a moment is special, the songs I used to sing as a young girl when I first started performing, and above all those which taught me to love music, and how music can move you so deeply, regardless of its genre or style\".\n\nThe album also features duets with Tiziano Ferro, Juanes and Johnny Hallyday. It debuted at number one on the Italian Albums Chart and held the top spot for 8 non-consecutive weeks. It also became the best-selling album of 2006 in Italy, selling 500,000 copies in less than two months. On 8 November 2007, the album won Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the Latin Grammy Awards. Laura dedicated the award to the memory of Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti.

The first single from the album, \"Benvenuto\" / \"Bienvenido\", was released on 12 September 2011.\n\nIn order to promote the album, Pausini engaged the Inedito World Tour, starting with 11 shows in Italy in late December 2011. The tour reached Latin America in January and February 2012. The European leg of her tour visited the principle arenas of France, Switzerland, Spain, Germany, Belgium and Holland, and concluded at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nThe album also spawned the singles \"Non ho mai smesso\" / \"Jamás abandoné\", \"Bastava\" / \"Bastaba\", \"Mi tengo\" and \"Le cose che non mi aspetto\".\n\nOn 25 June 2012, Pausini took part in the mega-concert Concerto per l'Emilia, organized to raise funds in support of the people affected by the 2012 Northern Italy earthquakes. During the show, Pausini dueted with Cesare Cremonini, performing a cover of Lucio Dalla's \"L'anno che verrÃ \".\n\nIt was confirmed by Pausini that the DVD of the tour is being released on Christmas 2012, in both Italian and Spanish. They were recorded, respectively, in Bologna on April 17 and in Madrid on April 20 2012.\n\nArtistry\n\nLaura Pausini is described as a mezzo-soprano with a classic and powerful voice. Due to her voice, Pausini has been compared by music critics to various female artists, including Milva, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey and Barbra Streisand.\n\nAt the beginning of her career, she has been considered by music critics as a teen idol mainly singing about adolescent love affairs and problems. She was also strongly criticized for her songs, described as too melancholic and trivial. Starting from her 1998's La mia risposta / Mi respuesta, Italian music critics considered her as a more mature singer and later praised her simplicity and her voice, describing Pausini as an interpreter of her years.\n\nAlthough Pausini is mainly a melodic pop singer, her musical style evolved during her career, with influences from various genres, including Latin music, soul music and rock music. In 2001, David Cazares of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel described Pausini's music as \"an assortment of glossy and sentimental pop ballads backed by light rock instrumentation and synthesized strings\". In 2006, The Washington Post's Achy Obejas wrote that Pausini is distinguished from other Latin pop singer by her sophistication and her European sensibilities. According to Musica e dischi's Antonio Orlando, the key elements in Pausini's style are romanticism, optimism, melancholy and surrounding melodies.\n\nStarting from her 1996's album Le cose che vivi / Las cosas que vives, Pausini has also co-wrote most of her songs and starting from her 1998's La mia risposta / Mi respuesta she has been involved in the production of her albums.\n\nPersonal life\n\nPausini left her hometown in 1995, when she moved to Milan with her partner, manager and producer Alfredo Cerruti Jr. Their relationship ended in 2002. Between 2002 and 2005 Pausini was romantically involved with her new manager, Gabriele Parisi. She is currently engaged with the Italian guitarist, composer, music producer and former singer Paolo Carta.\n\nPausini describes herself as a Roman Catholic woman, but expressed doubts about Roman Church's position on various themes, including contraception, abortion and premarital sex. In September 2000 she explained her position during an interview to the Italian newspaper la Repubblica:\n\n    I believe so much in God, and the Pope is the man I want to meet the most in the world. I've known him in 1996. I just have a few doubts about the Catholic Church, like for example the discrimination against homosexuals. I don't understand why they condemn racism, but at the same time they take issue with gay people.\n",

        "strBiographyEN" : "\"Lauren Ashley Daigle\"  (born September 9, 1991) is an American singer from Lafayette, Louisiana. Daigle sings contemporary Christian music and is signed to the Centricity Music label. \nChristian praise & worship singer and songwriter Lauren Daigle was always singing around the house as a child, but it wasn't until a serious illness kept her out of school for nearly two years beginning when she was 15 years old that she turned completely to music as both solace and a profession. Home schooled during that time, music became Daigle's hedge against social isolation, and she began singing at her local church as a praise & worship leader. Blessed with a striking and smoky alto singing voice, she was encouraged to try out for the American Idol television series, which she did in both 2010 and 2012. The stressful and demanding process of trying out for the show taught her a lot of valuable lessons, and she returned home determined to sharpen her writing and singing skills. She began pursuing a Child and Family Studies degree at Louisiana State University, and while there, was asked by a local band to help with vocals on an EP recording project. A demo of the EP somehow made it to the Centricity Music label, and impressed with her vocals, the label signed Daigle as a solo artist in 2013.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "During his college years, Leff strayed from his intensely personal song-writing style and focused on writing and producing for other artists. But during his sophomore year, he stumbled upon an illuminating interview with Paul Simon, in which Simon described his song-writing approach as a process of uncovering his innermost buried feelings. The interview helped Leff to get in touch with the way he used to write.\n\nShortly after, Leff adopted the stage name Lauv, Latvian for 'lion'. This is a nod to his mother's heritage; his first name, Ari, meaning 'lion' in Hebrew; and to his own zodiac sign, Leo.\n\nThen, while recovering from a break-up in 2014, he revealed his feelings through co-writing \"The Other\" with Michael Matosic.This was a fusion of rhythm and blues and indie-pop with influence from jazz guitar. He felt that the song was special to him, so he did not want to give it up to another artist. He released the song under his stage name. The song gained blog attention and went viral, peaking at number three on blog aggregator Hype Machine, and hitting the Global Top 100 on Spotify.\n\nAfter graduating, Leff signed to the publishing company Prescription Songs.\n\nIn 2015, Leff released his debut EP, Lost in the Light, which featured \"The Other\".\n\nThen, apart from releasing a single titled \"Question\" featuring Travis Mills, Leff worked on writing and producing songs for other artists. Most notably, he co-wrote and co-produced \"No Promises\" for Cheat Codes and Demi Lovato.\n\nOn May 19, 2017, Leff released the single \"I Like Me Better\", an up-tempo track which also achieved popularity. The song was inspired by his relationship which started two months after he had first moved to New York City to further his studies.\n\nIn the same year, he headed his own Late Nights, Deep Talks tour in which he performed in 8 cities across the United States. The tour began on May 23 in Los Angeles and concluded on June 7 in New York City. On July 9, he also performed in Summerfest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nIt was announced on September 4, 2017, that Leff would be joining Ed Sheeran as the supporting act on his Divide Tour in Asia",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Leona Louise Lewis (born 3 April 1985) is a British singer, songwriter and animal welfare campaigner. She was born and raised in the London Borough of Islington, London, England where she attended the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology. Lewis achieved national recognition when she won the third series of The X Factor in 2006, winning a £1 million recording contract with Simon Cowell's record label, Syco Music. Her winner's single, a cover of Kelly Clarkson's \"A Moment Like This\", peaked at number one for four weeks on the UK Singles Chart and it broke a world record for having 50,000 digital downloads within 30 minutes. In February 2007, Lewis signed a five-album contract in the United States with Clive Davis's record label, J Records.\nLewis's success continued with the release of her debut album, Spirit, in 2007; it went 10x platinum in the United Kingdom, while the lead single, \"Bleeding Love\", spent seven weeks at number-one. She achieved international recognition with the album in 2008, when she became the first British female solo artist to top the US Billboard 200 album chart in more than 20 years. Spirit has sold more than eight million copies worldwide, and \"Bleeding Love\" peaked at number one in over 30 countries, becoming the best-selling single of 2008. As a result, she was proclaimed 'Top New Artist' by Billboard in 2008. Under the guidance of Cowell and Davis, Lewis released her second UK number-one album Echo and recorded the theme song for the film Avatar in 2009, while embarking on her first UK arena tour, The Labyrinth, in 2010.\nIn 2011, Lewis released the non-album single \"Collide\", a collaboration with Swedish DJ Avicii, and her first extended play, Hurt: The EP. Her third album, Glassheart, was released in 2012. It marked a new creative direction for Lewis, drawing inspiration from dubstep and electronic music. However, it failed to match the commercial performance of her two previous albums, peaking at number three on the UK Albums Chart and becoming her first to not be certified platinum. Lewis began to record material for her first Christmas album during her Glassheart Tour, which took place in mid 2013. Christmas, with Love was released later that year. Its lead single, \"One More Sleep\", peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart. With this chart entry, Lewis became the first British female solo artist to achieve eight top 5 singles, surpassing Olivia Newton-John's record of seven. In 2014, English recording artist Cheryl Cole equaled this tally, and they hold the record jointly.\nWith a career spanning eight years, Lewis is the best-selling act to have emerged from The X Factor franchise, having sold 20 million records worldwide. Lewis has won one Bambi Award, 5 MTV Europe Music Award nominations, an MTV Video Music Award and three World Music Awards. She is also a seven-time Brit Award and three-time Grammy Award nominee. Lewis is known for her expansive four octave mezzo-soprano vocal range, power, technical control and, in particular, her frequent use of the falsetto register. Aside from her musical career, Lewis is a philanthropist and an animal welfare campaigner for World Animal Protection and is a supporter of other animal rights charities and organisations; she is also a vegetarian. In 2014, Lewis made her film debut in the supporting role of Elena in the romantic comedy musical, Walking on Sunshine.",

Cohen has been inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is also a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honour.\nWhile giving the speech at Cohen's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 10 March 2008, Lou Reed described Cohen as belonging to the \"highest and most influential echelon of songwriters.\"\nCohen was born into a middle-class Jewish family and attended Roslyn Elementary School. His mother, Marsha Klinitsky, of Lithuanian Jewish ancestry, emigrated from Lithuania while his great-grandfather emigrated from Poland. He grew up in Westmount on the Island of Montreal. His grandfather was Lyon Cohen, founding president of the Canadian Jewish Congress. His father, Nathan Cohen, who owned a substantial Montreal clothing store, died when Cohen was nine years old. On the topic of being a Kohen, Cohen has said that, \"I had a very Messianic childhood.\" He told Richard Goldstein in 1967. \"I was told I was a descendant of Aaron, the high priest.\" Cohen attended Westmount High School, beginning in 1948 where he was involved with the Student Council and studied music and poetry. He became especially interested in the poetry of Federico Garcia Lorca. As a teenager, he learned to play the guitar, and formed a country-folk group called the Buckskin Boys. Although he initially played a regular acoustic guitar as a teenager, he soon switched to playing a classical guitar after meeting a young Spanish flamenco guitar player who taught him \"a few chords and some flamenco.\"",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Lil Dicky is the voice of the voiceless. In an era where rap is dominated by racial, social, and economic minorities, LD decided to put the upper-middle class on his frail, Jewish shoulders.  The results have been monumental. His debut mixtape, So Hard, has been categorized as \"funny,\" and \"impressive\" by his friends.  A non-traditional rapper, Lil Dicky uses a mix of comedy, lyrical ingenuity, and self-deprecation to spew out entertaining and relatable content.  When he was 14, he opened up for the R&B group 112 at his overnight camp. He's been rapping ever since.  Currently, he's had sex with 4 women, but he's hoping that number goes up with time, patience, and a positive outlook.  At night, he'll pee sitting down, due to fatigue.  Join him on his quest to change rap forever.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Jonathan Smith (born January 27, 1971), better known by his stage name Lil Jon, is an American rapper, record producer, entrepreneur, and international DJ who was a member of the group Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz. Lil Jon formed the group in 1997, and the group released several albums between then and 2004.\n\nBeginnings\nBorn and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, Smith graduated from Frederick Douglass High School in Atlanta. After working as a DJ for Atlanta night clubs, he worked for So So Def Recordings between 1993 and 2000.\n\nSmith took the stage name Lil Jon and formed musical group Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz, with rappers Big Sam (born Sammie Dernard Norris) and Lil' Bo (born Wendell Maurice Neal). The group signed to the Atlanta-based Mirror Image Records and were distributed by Ichiban Records. In 1997, Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz debuted with Get Crunk, Who U Wit: Da Album. It included singles \"Who U Wit?\" and \"Shawty Freak a Lil' Sumthin'\", the latter of which came out in 1998. Both singles charted on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart at No. 70 and No. 62, respectively.\n\nIn 2000, Jon co-founded the label, BME Recordings, with his three long time friends,Vince Phillips, Rob Mac and Emperor Searcy. He released his breakthrough album titled We Still Crunk!. Among the tracks on that project was the hit single \"I Like Those Girls,\" which reached No. 55 on the R&B chart and No. 3 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart.\n\nLil Jon was talked about as \"the new guy\" by street team people in the markets where he was attracting his biggest audiences – namely Atlanta, St. Louis, Memphis and Dallas. Bryan Leach, A&R at TVT, went to one of Lil Jon's Atlanta shows and was blown away by its immense energy. Leach told HitQuarters: \"It was like early Beastie Boys, when they had the energy of a rock group but they were rapping, and ... that energy is what crunk music is all about.\"\n\nLil Jon & The East Side Boyz signed to TVT Records in 2001 and debuted there with Put Yo Hood Up, which combined previously released tracks with new ones. The group's first nationally played single was \"Bia' Bia'\", which featured rappers Ludacris, Too Short, Big Kapp, and Chyna Whyte. \"Bia' Bia'\" peaked at No. 97 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 47 on the Billboard R&B chart.\n\nIn 2002, the group released Kings of Crunk. \"I Don't Give A...\" was its first single; it featured Mystikal and Krayzie Bone and peaked at No. 50 on the R&B chart. The group's next single, a collaboration with fellow Atlanta hip hop group Ying Yang Twins titled \"Get Low\", became popular in nightclubs nationwide; it reached the top ten of the Hot 100. Crunk Juice followed in 2004, led by \"What U Gon' Do\" featuring Lil' Scrappy. \"What U Gon' Do\" peaked at No. 22 on the Hot 100, No. 13 on the R&B chart, and No. 5 on the rap chart; its follow-up, \"Lovers & Friends\" featuring Usher and Ludacris, peaked at No. 3 (Hot 100), No. 2 (R&B), and No. 1 (rap).\n\nSolo career and production\nLil Jon has also produced many hit urban singles. From 2003 to 2005, while still with The East Side Boyz, Lil Jon produced hits such as \"Salt Shaker\" by Ying Yang Twins, \"Yeah!\" by Usher, \"Freek-a-Leek\" by Petey Pablo, \"Shorty Wanna Ride\" by Young Buck, \"Shake That Monkey\" by Too Short, \"Girlfight\" by Brooke Valentine, \"Presidential\" by YoungBloodZ. Lil Jon entered the San Francisco Bay Area hyphy music scene in 2006 with his collaborations with Bay Area rapper E-40: Lil Jon produced E-40's single \"Tell Me When To Go\" and had E-40 and Atlanta rapper, Sean P of the YoungBloodZ, on his own \"Snap Yo Fingers\". During that same year he produced a song called \"Go to Church\" for Ice Cube.\n\nIn 2006, Lil Jon severed his negotiation with record label TVT. He vowed never to record for TVT Records again, alleging that TVT owner Steve Gottlieb was shortchanging him. He also began recording a rock music album, Crunk Rock.\n\nMTV News reported in March 2008 that Crunk Rock was taking more time to complete than Lil Jon planned. As part of TVT Records' 2008 bankruptcy auction, Lil Jon withdrew his multimillion-dollar objection to the TVT sale proceedings and agreed to TVT's transfer of his artist agreement to The Orchard. In return, The Orchard released Lil Jon from all future obligations and returned the rights to the master recordings of Crunk Rock.\n\nCrunk Rock was released on June 8, 2010, and it features artists such as LMFAO, Soulja Boy, Ying Yang Twins, Waka Flocka Flame, R. Kelly, and many more. In March 2011, Lil Jon took part in the fourth season of Celebrity Apprentice on NBC and was eliminated in the Final Four.\n\nIn July 2011, he said that he is working on a new studio album called Party Animal and has released a song with LMFAO called \"Drink\", which was used in the trailer for the film The World's End. In 2013, Lil Jon partnered with Zumba Fitness to create a new nightclub tour titled \"Zumba Nightclub Series\". For Zumba Fitness, he released a new song called \"Work\".\n\nIn January 2014, Lil Jon collaborated with DJ Snake and released \"Turn Down for What\" on Columbia Records. In February 2014, the single entered the top 5 on the Dance/Electronic chart and debuted at number 38 on Billboard's Hot 100. The song peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went on to be certified 5x Platinum by the RIAA.\n\nOn July 22, 2014, Lil Jon released a single titled \"Bend Ova\", featuring Tyga and released on Epic Records. The song reached number 92 on the Billboard Hot 100. His latest single \"Take It Off\" featuring Yandel and Becky G was released on July 22, 2016.\n\nMusical style and influences\nJason Birchmeier of AllMusic has described Lil Jon's production as \"bass-heavy,\" and his album Put Yo Hood Up as having \"a long and varied list of guest rappers to accompany the beats\". Describing that album with guest performers, Birchmeier remarked: \"The end result is an album that resembles a street-level mixtape rather than a traditional artist-oriented album\".\n\nLil Jon was specifically influenced by 2 Live Crew, 8Ball & MJG, Three 6 Mafia, OutKast, Geto Boys, UGK, N.W.A, Dr. Dre, and Sir Mix-A-Lot. Alex Henderson, also of allmusic, contrasted Lil Jon's style of \"rowdy, in-your-face, profanity-filled party music\" with other Southern rappers, those who \"have a gangsta/thug life agenda\" and those who convey \"serious sociopolitical messages\". Lil Jon has also found influence in rock music, having worked with Rick Rubin and Korn. He expresses this influence in his aggressive delivery and 'yelling' style of rap. He was seen on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of All-Time program wearing a Bad Brains T-shirt, and he used to listen to Lynyrd Skynyrd while growing up in the South in the 1970s. For Trick Daddy's \"Let's Go\", Lil Jon sampled the bass line from Ozzy Osbourne's \"Crazy Train\".\n\nTelevision\nLil Jon has been a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice, finishing 4th in its 11th season and 3rd in its 13th season, The All-Star Celebrity Apprentice. While on the show, it was reported that Donald Trump had referred to Lil Jon repeatedly as \"Uncle Tom\" until confronted by Lil Jon and other members of the crew.\n\nPersonal life\nLil Jon married Nicole Smith in 2004. They have a son named Nathan Smith (born 1998).\n\nHe was an avid fan of the NHL's Atlanta Thrashers until they relocated to Winnipeg in 2011. He has since become a fan of the NHL's newest franchise, the Vegas Golden Knights. He has recently also become a fan of the University of Tennessee Volunteers, which adopted his hit song \"Turn Down for What\" on third downs, changing it to \"Third Down for What.\" On October 4, 2014, Lil Jon made an appearance via Jumbotron encouraging the Volunteers to beat the University of Florida Gators.\n\nLil Jon is a fan of the television show The Walking Dead and has made multiple appearances as a guest on Talking Dead.",

She is the daughter of Keith Allen and film producer Alison Owen. Allen left school when she was 15 and concentrated on improving her performing and compositional skills. In 2005, she made some of her recordings public on Myspace and the publicity resulted in airplay on BBC Radio 1 and a contract with Regal Recordings.\nHer first mainstream single, \"Smile\", reached number one on the UK Singles Chart in July 2006. Her debut record, Alright, Still, was well received, selling over 2.6 million copies worldwide and brought Allen a nomination at the Grammy Awards, Brit Awards and MTV Video Music Awards. She began hosting her own talk-show, Lily Allen and Friends, on BBC Three.\nHer second studio album, It's Not Me, It's You, saw a genre shift, having more of an electropop feel, rather than the ska and reggae influences of the first one. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and the Australian ARIA Charts and was well received by critics, noting the singer's musical evolution and maturity. It spawned the hit singles \"The Fear\" and \"Fuck You\". This success saw her receive the Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist at the 2010 Brit Awards. Allen and Amy Winehouse were credited with starting a process that led to the \"year of the women\" media label in 2009 that saw five female artists making music of \"experimentalism and fearlessness\" nominated for the Mercury Prize.\nIn 2009, Allen announced that she would be taking a hiatus from musical activities. In 2011, she launched her own record label. In 2013, Allen revealed that she had begun working on her third studio album, which was later titled Sheezus. On 12 November 2013, Allen premiered the video for her first original song since 2009, \"Hard out Here\", which was released as a single five days later.",

As of 2012, the band consists of Fred Durst (vocals), Wes Borland (guitar), Sam Rivers (bass), and John Otto (drums). Formed in 1994, Limp Bizkit started playing in the Jacksonville, Florida underground music scene in the late 1990s, signing with Flip Records and releasing their début album Three Dollar Bill, Yall$ in 1997. The band achieved mainstream success and notoriety with their second and third studio albums, Significant Other (1999) and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000). To date, the group has sold over 33 million records worldwide.\nBorland left the group in 2001, and Durst, Rivers, Otto and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist Mike Smith. Following the release of their album Results May Vary (2003), Borland rejoined the band and recorded The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal and drummer Sammy Siegler before going on hiatus. In 2009, the band's original lineup reunited and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album Gold Cobra (2011), after which they left Interscope and later signed with Cash Money Records.\nFred Durst grew up in Gastonia, North Carolina, where he took an interest in breakdancing, hip hop, punk rock and heavy metal. He began to rap, skate, beatbox and deejay. While mowing lawns and working as a tattoo artist, he developed an idea for a band that combined elements of rock and hip hop. Durst played with three other bands, Split 26, Malachi Sage, which were unsuccessful, and 10 Foot Shindig, which Durst left to form a new band. Durst told Sam Rivers, the bassist for Malachi Sage, \"You need to quit this band and start a band with me that's like this: rappin' and rockin'.\" Rivers suggested that his cousin, John Otto, who was studying jazz drumming at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts and playing in local avant garde bands, become their drummer. Durst, Rivers and Otto jammed and wrote three songs together, and Wes Borland later joined as a guitarist.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Stirling was born in Orange County, California and grew up in Gilbert, Arizona. She moved to Provo, Utah to attend Brigham Young University to study therapeutic recreation. She went on to serve as a missionary in New York City for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She later returned to Provo and resided there until December 2012, when she moved back to Arizona to be closer to her family.\nAt the age of 5, after being influenced by the classical music records played by her father, Stirling began to study the violin. She took private lessons for 12 years. When she was 16, she joined a rock band with four friends called Stomp on Melvin. As part of her experience with Stomp on Melvin, Stirling wrote a solo violin rock song, and her performance helped her to win the state title of Arizona's Junior Miss and claim the Spirit Award in the America's Junior Miss Finals competition. Stirling was also a member of the Charlie Jenkins Band.\n\n\nStirling at rehearsals.\nIn 2010, at the age of 23, Stirling was a quarter-finalist on the fifth season of America's Got Talent, where she was described as a \"hip hop violinist\". Stirling's performances were dubbed \"electrifying\" by the judges, and won the acclaim of the audience, but after she attempted to step up the dance level in her quarter-final performance judge Piers Morgan told her, \"You're not untalented, but you're not good enough to get away with flying through the air and trying to play the violin at the same time\". Sharon Osbourne commented, \"You need to be in a group. ... What you're doing is not enough to fill a theater in Vegas\". In her blog, Stirling confided, \"I was devastated at the results ... It was painful, and a bit humiliating; however, I had to relearn where it was that I drew my strength\". Stirling decided to continue to embrace her unique style of performance, promoting herself on the Internet. In a 2012 interview she remarked, \"A lot of people have told me along the way that my style and the music I do ... is unmarketable. But the only reason I'm successful is because I have stayed true to myself\".\nShortly after her performance on America's Got Talent, cinematographer Devin Graham contacted her in hopes of making a YouTube video together. They agreed to shoot a music video for her song, \"Spontaneous Me\". It was filmed the week of May 9, 2011. The video boosted Stirling's popularity, and she began making music videos for her YouTube channel regularly. Graham has filmed almost all of her videos, while Stirling often does backup camera work and assists with his music videos. Stirling's YouTube channel, Lindseystomp, which she created in 2007 and which is named after her first band \"Stomp on Melvin\", is the main repository for her music videos. During 2011, the channel rapidly gained popularity and has over 250 million total views and over 1.9 million subscribers, as of March 2013. Her music is featured on Pandora, Spotify, and Last.FM. Stirling also created a second YouTube channel, LindseyTime, in September 2012, in which she posts videos related to her life, vlogs, behind-the-scenes content, etc.\n\n\nStirling performing at VidCon 2012.\nStirling has experimented in combining violin playing with hip hop and dubstep. Stirling's collaborations with other musicians and singers have included Shaun Barrowes (on \"Don't Carry It All\" – The Decemberists), Jake Bruene and Frank Sacramone (on \"Party Rock Anthem\" – LMFAO), Tay Zonday (on \"Mama Economy\"), Peter Hollens (on \"Skyrim\" and later with \"Game of Thrones\"), Alisha Popat (on \"We Found Love\"), John Allred (on \"Tomb\"), Kurt Schneider and Amiee Proal (on A Thousand Years), Megan Nicole (on \"Starships\"), The Piano Guys (on \"Mission Impossible\"), and Tyler Ward (on \"Thrift Shop\"). She has also collaborated with the Salt Lake Pops orchestra and Alex Boye. Stirling's debut album was released on September 18, 2012 in conjunction with a North American tour that same month.\nStirling completed her first US Tour on November 26, 2012. She announced on December 3, 2012 that she is working on putting together a European tour, as well as another US tour starting in January 2013. The Tour will cover 55 cities throughout Europe, Canada & the US and last until April 5th, 2013. On February 25th 2013 she announced a new European tour, which will kick off in Moscow on May 22nd and end in Norrkoping, Sweden, June 29th, with a total of 26 cities covered.\nIn December 2012, YouTube announced that Stirling's song, \"Crystallize\", was the #8 top viewed video of 2012 with over 42 Million views. Stirling recently completed collaborations with Youtube Artists Tyler Ward and Pentatonix.",

I knew of hip-hop, but it wasn’t my life yet. Around 14, 15, I saw Kill Bill and I found out the score was done by RZA. I heard it and was like, “Oh, this shit is awesome!” I was a nerd then. I was into fucking anime and Kung-Fu and shit, so I heard it and thought it was incredible. And I didn’t know who or what RZA was. So I checked his music out and through that found Wu-Tang. And through that I found Nas, Big L, Jay-Z, A Tribe Called Quest, KRS-One, Rakim. Just so many. I started on real golden era hip-hop.\n\nWhen I was, like, 18, that’s when I started to really take my own craft seriously and just noticed people were enjoying it. And when I put out my first mixtape, that’s when I realized I could make this a career. I remember being that dude on Facebook like, “Yo, check my shit out!” and like going on YouTube and telling people to check me out. Now to be on this, like some of my favorite rappers—J. Cole, Kendrick, Big K.R.I.T.—have been on previous covers, and I would always look at them and be like ‘Man, I can’t wait to get there.” And now I’m here. This right here is going to set up my career and it’s up to me to live up to this hype. Three years ago, when nobody knew who I was, I told myself, “I am going to be an XXL Freshman in 2013. I knew it. In 2010 when I dropped my first mixtape, I wanted to be there with Cole and Sean, but I knew I had to wait. And I did.\n\nIn 2011, I was on the radio at the University of Maryland and I spit this freestyle. I looked to my right and saw the XXL cover, and I just picked it up while I was freestyling and said “My future’s looking XXL, this shit is medium.” If that’s not a premonition, I don’t know what is. I know there’s people now reading this and they look at me like, “Wow, yo that’s Logic,” but I still feel like that cat that nobody knew. I’m still not really that known in the hip-hop community, but I have a humongous fan base outside. We did things backward. A lot of people start in hip-hop and then they have to branch out. But we just have this crazy fanbase. Sometimes I just wake up and I’m like, “How the hell did I get here?”\n\nSee, I didn’t have anyone growing up. My parents were drug addicts and alcoholics. I just saw all this negative stuff and everyone who was around me fell into it. So it was really hard, but I realize that it helped me become the man I am today. As much time and effort, emotion, anger, love, joy that you put into another human being, you’re not guaranteed to receive that back. And that’s OK. That’s alright. But I took all of those things and put it into my music. And I realized everything I put into my music, I get back. Every hour, day, month, year. I get it back. I don’t party. I don’t drink. I don’t smoke. None of that shit. And it’s not because I don’t like it. It’s because I’d rather make the sacrifice now. I could go to some parties now, or I could wait and party with Kanye and Jay in a couple of years. That’s how I see it.",

At Lake Huron, he developed songs for the first Lord Huron EP. He named the recording, Into the Sun. Upon his return to L.A., Schneider set to work putting a band together. The first to join him was his percussion-playing childhood friend Mark. Each of the band members of band hail from Michigan.  Into The Sun and Mighty Lord Huron released two EPs in 2010, Into the Sun and Mighty. Pop & Hiss, the LA Times Music Blog, described Mighty as \"full of lush acoustic guitars and Midwestern-accented harmonies as warm as a winter fireplace, but it's the Caribbean-influenced percussion that fans Lord Huron's folk sound into flame,\"and Pitchfork could only classify it as \"a stylistic superball, bouncing off any wall you put around it.\" NPR's World Cafe wrote \"the band's lush harmonies are backed by a hazy whirlpool of polyrhythmic tropical drums and folk guitars.\" Despite the fact that Schneider played all of the instruments on both EPs, he has gathered a band for live performances, which have also gotten positive reviews. \"The totality of the experience was like being on hand for a combination drum circle, chamber performance, and Calypso street party,\" wrote LA Weekly.Some of the larger shows the band has performed at include Lollapalooza (2011) and Outside Lands (2011), as well as a marathon ten shows in four days at the SXSW (2011) music festival.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor (born 7 November 1996), better known by her stage name Lorde (/lɔːrd/), is a New Zealand singer-songwriter. Born in Takapuna and raised in Devonport, Auckland, she became interested in performing as a child. In her early teens, she signed with Universal Music Group and was later paired with the songwriter and record producer Joel Little, who has co-written and produced most of Lorde's works. Her first major release, The Love Club EP, was commercially released in March 2013. The EP reached number two on the national record charts of Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn mid-2013, Lorde released her debut single \"Royals\". It became an international crossover hit and made Lorde the youngest solo artist to achieve a US number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 since 1987. In late 2013, she released her debut studio album, Pure Heroine. The record topped the charts of Australia and New Zealand and reached number three on the US Billboard 200. Its following singles include \"Tennis Court\", \"Team\", \"No Better\" and \"Glory and Gore\". In 2014, Lorde released \"Yellow Flicker Beat\" as a single from the soundtrack for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1.\n\nLorde's music consists of subgenres such as dream pop and indietronica. She has earned two Grammy Awards, a Brit Award and ten New Zealand Music Awards. In 2013, she was named among Time's most influential teenagers in the world, and in the following year, she was in Forbes's \"30 Under 30\" list.\n\nOf Croatian and Irish descent, Ella Yelich-O'Connor was born in Takapuna to Vic O'Connor, a civil engineer, and Sonja Yelich, a poet, on November 7, 1996. She was raised in the nearby suburb of Devonport with her two sisters, Jerry and India, and her brother, Angelo.\n\nAt age five, she joined a drama group and developed public speaking skills. At that same time, Lorde was attending Vauxhall School and later Belmont Intermediate School. Her mother encouraged her to read a range of genres, which Lorde cited as a lyrical influence, \"I guess my mum influenced my lyrical style by always buying me books. She'd give me a mixture of kid and adult books too, there weren't really any books I wasn't allowed to read. I remember reading Feed by M.T. Anderson when I was six, and her giving me Salinger and Carver at a young age, and Janet Frame really young too.\"",

Marco Antonio was the writer of the songs and the band sold in one year one million records earning them a \"diamond disc\" for that record.  Marco Antonio Solís also wrote and produced albums for artists such as Marisela, Rocío Dúrcal, and María Sorté. After years of a successful career with \"Los Bukis\" Marco Antonio decided to pursue a solo career. At first Marco Antonio Solís was called \"El Buki\" but after an agreement with the rest of the band both parties agreed to not make use of the name.

He first begun recording in 1992 under his first name Luciana, with his debut single \"Ebony & Ivory\" on the Aquarius Record label and followed with his debut album 'Moving Up' for RAS records in 1993. Luciano is the seventh of nine children and was born to extremely spiritual and musical parents while growing up in Daveyton, a small district in the central parish of Manchester, Jamaica.   2) Luciano, born in 1978 in Switzerland and raised in Chile, started DJing in 1993 and producing elctronic music since 1997. In the mid-90's, he was promoting Sense Club and Encuentros con la Technocultura in Santiago de Chile in the company of many initiators of the Latin American electronic music scene: Senor Coconut AKA Atom Heart, Ricardo Villalobos, Pier Bucci, Dandy Jack & brother Adrian Schopf, Washington Miranda, Argenix Brito, Microman, etc.  Luciano left Chile at 21 and moved to Europe (2000), settling in Geneva (Switzerland) to launch Mental Groove Records and holding a residency at the Weetamix club. He gradually invaded the inner reaches of electronic culture, forming a partnership with Ibiza's most notorious underground club, Circoloco at DC10, which gave Luciano a perfect platform and a passionate audience for his irresistible, mind-altering blend of barebones techno and hot-blooded Latin rhythms. His releases appear on the Transmat, Perlon, Lo-Fi Stereo, Bruchstuecke and Klang Elektronik record labels.  Luciano's mixed Swiss & Chilean identity shows in his music, a somewhat mystical blend of deep techno & electro that integrates southern elements in rhythms and colourful patterns in sound. His collaborations with Ricardo Villalobos (Playhouse, Perlon, Warp, Force Inc etc.) as Sense Club are especially rewarding, as is his partnership with Pier Bucci and Argenix Brito as Monne Automne.  Mellowing his style as times goes by, getting more experimental and spacey with a fresh style of his own, Luciano's production is destined to the wiser dancefloors.  2) Luciano (born in 1978) is a Swiss-Chilean DJ, producer and boss of Cadenza Records.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Ludovico Einaudi (born 23 November 1955) is an Italian pianist and Alt-Classical musician. After training at the Conservatorio Verdi in Milan and under composer Luciano Berio in the early 1980s, Einaudi started his career as a classical composer and soon began incorporating other styles and genres, including pop, rock, world music, and folk music.\nEinaudi composed the scores for a number of films and trailers, including Intouchables, I'm Still Here, Doctor Zhivago, and Acquario in 1996, for which he won the Grolla d'oro for best soundtrack. He has also released a number of solo albums of piano and orchestra, notably I Giorni in 2001, Nightbook in 2009, and In a Time Lapse in 2013.\n\nEinaudi began using his style to compose film soundtracks in the mid-1990s. He started with two films by Michele Sordillo, Da qualche parte in città in 1994 and Acquario in 1996, for which he won the Grolla d'oro for best soundtrack. In 1998 he composed the soundtrack with Treno di panna, and that same year wrote the score for Giorni dispari by Dominick Tambasco.\n\nIn 2000 he collaborated with Antonello Grimaldi on Un delitto impossible, and he also composed the soundtrack for Fuori del mondo, which was nominated for an Oscar Award and for which he won the Echo Klassik award in Germany in 2002.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Luis Alfonso Rodríguez López-Cepero, more commonly known as Luis Fonsi, (born April 15, 1978 in San Juan, Puerto Rico) is a Latin Grammy winning Puerto Rican singer, composer and soap opera actor.  Fonsi and his family moved to Orlando, Florida, during Fonsi's early childhood. Fonsi's childhood was relatively average for kids his age, beginning to dream about becoming a member of Menudo, arguably Latin America's most famous boy band in history, around the time he was ten years old.  Because of the air distance between his home in Orlando and Menudo's base back in Puerto Rico in particular, Fonsi was not able to achieve that particular childhood dream. He did, however, participate in many local boy bands, including one, Big Guys, where he met, and befriended, future *NSYNC member Joey Fatone. On April of that year, Fonsi had a brief return to the singing stage, when former Menudo Ray Reyes invited him and Lopez to a concert which was held at San Juan's Roberto Clemente coliseum. The press widely covered what El Vocero titled as Fonsi's moment as a Menudo, when he took the stage and joined the members of El Reencuentro to sing some of their old hits.  Fonsi's popularity has transcended ages and genres in Puerto Rico: industrialist Salvador Vassallo, for example, has told El Vocero that Fonsi is among his favorite singers.  Instead of choosing to keep a pattern of trying to find stardom in the United States with a boy band, Fonsi chose to better prepare himself for a future, stable career inside show business. He went to Florida State University to study vocal techniques. Meanwhile, he began to record demo tapes in Miami. While he was at FSU, he was overheard singing by a university music department president, who offered him a contract with a large recording company.  In 1999, Fonsi recorded his first CD, Comenzare (I Will Begin). Comenzare became an instant hit in Puerto Rico and across Latin America, with Fonsi conquering such markets as Colombia, the Dominican Republic,El Salvador, Mexico and Venezuela. His 2000 follow-up, Eterno, was equally successful. By then, Fonsi's fame had reached Europe, as he became a celebrity in Spain as well.  During 2001, a re-mix of Comenzare and Eterno was launched, while Fonsi worked on his next album, 2002's Amor Secreto. At about the same time, some media outlets such as newspapers and magazines began to comment about an allegued, adulterous romance between him and an also very famous married Puerto Rican singer, who had just happened to separate from her husband recently and bought a home near Fonsi's Orlando property. The scandal did not last too long, however, and Fonsi soon released an album in English, Fight the Feeling, also released in 2002.  Fight the Feeling did not sell well among Americans. It is expected, however, that Fonsi will sometime in the future make a second attempt at a crossover: because of the fact he has lived most of his life in Orlando, he is fluent in English as well as in Spanish.  His Fourth CD sold very well which opened new markets in Europe. \"Quien te Dijo eso?\" reached high positions on music charts. His fifth CD \"Paso a Paso\" could be said to be his disc that launched him into international markets. \"Nada es Para Siempre\" reached Number one on the music chart beating famous, Shakira.  By 2003, Fonsi began to fall in love with actress Adamari Lopez, who, as an Univision artist and fellow Puerto Rican, constantly found herself near Fonsi. That same year, Fonsi released the song Abrazar la Vida (Holding on to Life), of the album also named Abrazar la Vida. The song, perhaps ironically and because of a particular circumstance, would later become one of Lopez's favorite songs. While Fight the Feeling was released by the MCA label, Abrazar la Vida was released by Universal's Spanish music label. Fonsi also recorded Amazing in 2003, a duet with Emma Bunton for her 2004 album Free Me.  Fonsi took off 2004, a year when rumors were reported by magazines, television news shows and newspapers that he and Lopez had committed to marry each other. During 2005, Fonsi was in the middle of an international tour that would have had him away from home for many months; the tour was abruptly cancelled when Lopez was diagnosed with cancer. Fonsi promised her to stay by her side, and has travelled with her back and forth between Mexico, Miami and Puerto Rico for various treatment and work related trips.  On June 3, 2006, Fonsi and Adamari Lopez were married in a religious ceremony in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico attended by many celebrities including Joey Fatone, Charytin, Ednita Nazario, and Carlos Ponce and his brother, aspiring Spanish-language singer Jean Rodriguez, who goes simply by Jean as his professional name.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri (April 19, 1970) is a Mexican singer. He is widely known only by the name Luis Miguel. An icon in the Spanish-speaking countries, he is often referred to as \"El Sol de México\" (The Sun of Mexico) or simply \"El Sol\" (The Sun).\nBeginning his musical career in his childhood, Luis Miguel has won five Grammys and four Latin Grammys among other numerous awards. He is considered as one of the top male pop vocalists in the world nowadays. His contribution to Latin pop music, along with his hermetic personal life, has made him a global figure of Latin music for almost three decades. He debuted on the professional music at 11 years old. At the age of fifteen, Luis Miguel received his first Grammy for his duet \"Me Gustas Tal Como Eres\" (I Like You Just The Way You Are) with Sheena Easton. In 1991, the RIAA gave him a recognition for the high sales of the albums Romance and Segundo Romance. Luis Miguel is the only Latin artist to have two Spanish-language albums (Romance and Segundo Romance) go platinum in the USA. He has achieved a long string of distinctions. Also among those was having his album Luis Miguel achieve gold and platinum certifications in four countries, including the United States, within just three days of its release.\nLuis Miguel is also known by his high-grossing tours and his outstanding live performances. His Amarte Es Un Placer Tour had a length of 8 months during 1999-2000 and run through 8 countries in two continents. The tour consisted of 105 concerts and was attended by approximately 1.5 million fans. It was the highest-grossing tour ever made by a Latin artist, as well as the most extended. These two records have been broken by his Mexico En La Piel Tour of 2005-2007, with a total of 124 concerts, over 1.4 millions spectators, and grossing over $95 million.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Lukas Graham is a Danish musical group signed to Copenhagen Records. The band consists of Lukas Graham Forchhammer (vocals), Mark Falgren (drums), Magnus Larsson (bass) and Kasper Daugaard (keyboard). The band has had two other keyboard players in the past, Anders Kirk and Morten Ristorp. Anders Kirk left the band by his own choice at the end of 2011. The band then needed a keyboardist, so Morten Ristorp, who otherwise is part of the producer team BackBone, joined the band until a regular replacement could be found. That turned out to be Kasper Daugaard, who joined the band in May 2012. \nTheir music combines elements of soul, funk, hiphop and pop. Forchhammer describes the genre as \"ghetto pop\", because it pulls together so many genres. \n\nCareer:\n\nBeginnings (2011-2012):\nThe band started its career in Denmark in late 2011 when it released two homemade YouTube videos of the band performing Criminal Mind and Drunk in the Morning, recorded in Lukas' home. The videos were shared on Facebook among friends, and soon they had several hundred thousand views. The band's soulful and funky sound quickly spread in the Copenhagen underground and through online postings, which led Copenhagen Records to sign them. Lukas Graham achieved commercial success in October 2011 with the release of its debut single. Its first Danish tour sold over 30,000 concert tickets, even though its album had not been released yet. \n\nDebut album (2012):\nThe group's debut album, entitled Lukas Graham, was released in Denmark on March 26, 2012, and went gold during the first week of release. \nThe album was produced, recorded and mixed at BackBone Studio. The songs were written by Lukas Forchhammer, Stefan Forrest, Sebastian Fogh and Brandon Beal.",

The disc's title track went on to earn a good deal of buzz among not only indie pop-centric bloggers but in the mainstream Swedish music press as well. She made her first appearance on Swedish MTV that same year, and the video for \"Little Bit\" was nominated for Best Video at the Swedish Grammy Awards. She soon signed with Atlantic for worldwide distribution of the Little Bit EP and her first album, 2008's Youth Novels. The album proved an international success and Lykke Li increased her visibility through touring, a guest spot on Swedish producer Kleerup's debut album, and appearances on late-night television talk shows. In 2011, Lykke Li returned with her atmospheric and edgy sophomore effort, Wounded Rhymes, which won plenty of plaudits worldwide. She subsequently went on to tour across Europe and North America that year, and appeared at a selection of summer festivals in 2012, including Pukkelpop in Belgium and Helsinki's Flow Festival. In 2013, Lykke Li contributed to David Lynch's second album, The Big Dream, performing vocals on the lead single \"I'm Waiting Here.\" That year she returned to the studio with long-term collaborator Björn Yttling, alongside Greg Kurstin (the Shins, Foster the People, Lily Allen) to record her third album, I Never Learn, which was released in May 2014.",

Failing to find work as a musician, he participated in medical experiments for money and worked on a road paving crew. In early 2012, he released an EP titled Rock and Roll Nightclub. The four-track-recorded album features skits and slowed-down vocals. It impressed his new label, Captured Tracks, enough that they agreed to release a full-length album. This release, entitled 2, was received well by critics, garnering a “Best New Music” designation from Pitchfork Media. One of his songs was licensed by U.S. retail outlet Target for a commercial.

He is signed to Rostrum Records and released his debut album, Blue Slide Park, on November 8, 2011.\nMalcolm James McCormick was born on January 19, 1992, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Karen Meyers, a photographer, and Mark McCormick, an architect. His father is Christian and his mother is Jewish; Miller was raised Jewish and had a Bar Mitzvah. He was raised in the Point Breeze part of Pittsburgh. Miller attended Winchester Thurston School and Taylor Allderdice High School. In high school, Miller decided to focus on his hip hop career, later noting, \"Once I hit 15, I got real serious about it and it changed my life completely ... I used to be into sports, play all the sports, go to all the high school parties. But once I found out hip-hop is almost like a job, that's all I did.\" Miller, a self-taught musician, plays piano, guitar, drums, and bass.\nMiller first started rapping at the age of fourteen. Before that, he wanted to be a singer-songwriter. Prior to changing his name to Mac Miller, he was known as EZ Mac and released the mixtape But My Mackin' Ain't Easy in 2007 at the age of fifteen. Miller was also part of rap group The Ill Spoken together with fellow Pittsburgh rapper, Beedie. The Ill Spoken released the mixtape How High in 2008. In 2009 Mac Miller released two mixtapes The Jukebox: Prelude to Class Clown and The High Life before getting signed to Rostrum Records. In 2009 at age 17, he made it to the final four in Rhyme Calisthenics, the MC competition at Shadow Lounge.\nIn early 2010, Miller signed with Rostrum Records. Rostrum president Benjy Grinberg met Miller while recording with Wiz Khalifa at ID Labs. Although Grinberg started giving Miller advice, he didn't show any interest in getting involved with his career until the artist began work on the K.I.D.S. mixtape, when, as he later told HitQuarters, Grinberg \"noticed a maturation in his sound and approach to his music.\" By that point Miller had started attracting interest from different record companies but chose Rostrum due to its location in his hometown and association with Wiz Khalifa. K.I.D.S. was released by the label in August 2010. The mixtape was inspired by the movie Kids. A significant breakthrough came in late 2010 when Miller embarked on his first tour, the Incredibly Dope Tour, selling out every location. In 2010, he won two awards at the Pittsburgh hip hop awards.",

He first gained international recognition by remixing songs by Jack Ü and Zedd, and later collaborated with artists including Omar LinX, Ookay, Jauz and Slushii. In January 2017, his song \"Alone\" appeared on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nMarshmello wears a custom helmet for public appearances. His identity is unknown. It has been frequently suggested that Marshmello is American DJ Chris Comstock, also known as Dotcom, whose style is similar to Marshmello's. Skrillex also referred to Marshmello as \"Chris\" in an interview. In addition, both are managed by Moe Shalizi and allegedly have the same tattoo and birthday.\n\nMarshmello's stage name, an alternative spelling of \"marshmallow\", and his marshmallow mascot head were both inspired by electro house music producer and DJ deadmau5, who also notably uses an alternate spelling for his stage name and performs wearing a \"dead mouse\" mascot head. Acknowledgement of deadmau5's contribution to Marshmello's persona is evident in the music video for \"Alone,\" which features Marshmello's pet mouse, Joel (Joel Zimmerman is deadmau5's real name). While Marshmello has not yet confirmed his true identity, the most widespread speculation is that, he is Chris Comstock, who is also known as Dotcom. Journalists have also speculated that Marshmello could be Martin Garrix, Jauz, or a collective of producers and DJs managed by Shalizi. On March 4, 2017, Feed Me posted an Instagram story of Dotcom in Marshmello's costume and another person with Marshmello's helmet.\n\nAfter his set at Electric Daisy Carnival in 2016, Marshmello jokingly \"revealed\" his true identity by taking off his helmet, but the performer on-stage was revealed to actually be Dutch producer Tiësto. The event was widely described as being a \"troll\", as the two artists have been seen with each other in other photos and had conflicting tour schedules, thus making it unlikely that Marshmello was actually Tiësto.\n\nOn July 8, 2017, Indian actress Urvashi Rautela posted a picture of her, Chris Comstock, Maejor and Moe Shalizi on Instagram, claiming Comstock to be Marshmello in her picture by tagging Marshmello instead of Comstock's personal account or other alias Dotcom.\n\nComstock was credited as the only songwriter other than featured vocalist, Khalid, by ASCAP for Marshmello's song \"Silence\".",

'Voy Que Quemo' seemed like the best song to release first, and we're feeling super excited and nervous.\"\n\nMau y Ricky partnered with Latin Grammy winner Julio Reyes Copello to produce their album and credit him for allowing them to grow artistically and teach them about following their intuition. \"We've grown as producers and songwriters, thanks to him. We also learned that the intuition of an artist is so important and it's something that needs to be respected because your intuition will differentiate you from others. We learned to write for ourselves and put out songs that will represent who we are.\"\n\nAnd that's exactly what Mau y Ricky did. They followed their intuition after listening to their song \"Arte\" which was almost going to be pitched to Wisin, but Ricky says, \"It didn't feel right for another artist to sing this song.\" Another man they have to thank for guiding them since they started composing at a very young age is their father, who has written hit singles like \"La Cima del Cielo,\" \"Déjame Llorar\" and \"Me Va a Extrañar.\"\n\n\"We've written songs together, so working with him helps you grow a lot because he's a very hard critic. Every song I've written since I was 8 years old, I'd run it by him and he'd give me feedback. He actually just heard the final product of our album and he loved it, thank God. But the best thing is that he's a fan of ours and we're huge fans of him. Yeah, he's my dad, but I'm a huge Ricardo Montaner fan.\"\n\nBesides a new album, Mau y Ricky fans can expect to see them onstage soon as they go out on tour. \"We haven't toured in such a long time because we were busy writing for others then started working on this album, but the stage is our natural habitat and where we feel most comfortable.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mau+y+Ricky\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Composer Max Richter was born in Germany in 1966 and grew up in the UK. He studied composition and piano at Edinburgh University, the Royal Academy of Music and in Florence with Luciano Berio. \n\nThough he has a strong background in the canons of classical music, his influences were more modern composers and in particular, Iannis Xenakis whose musical compositions applied mathematical and physical laws and Philip Glass whose sound was a major influence on Richter. His influences also include rock bands The Beatles, Pink Floyd and The Clash, as well as electronic music groups Kraftwerk and Autechre. \n\nAfter finishing his studies, he co-founded Piano Circus, a contemporary classical ensemble, where he stayed for ten years. With the ensemble, he commissioned and performed the works of experimental artists like Steve Reich, Arvo Pärt, Brian Eno and Julia Wolfe. Piano Circus’s performances incorporated found sounds and video, allowing Richter to integrate his love of sampling and electronics. After he left, he became involved in the UK’s thriving electronic scene, collaborating with The Future Sound of London and Roni Size.\n\nHe has released four solo albums: Memoryhouse (2002), Blue Notebooks (2004), Songs From Before (2006), and latest, 24 Postcards in Full Colour (2008), a collection of miniatures meant to be used as ringtones.\n\nRecently he has scored the soundtrack to the critically acclaimed film Waltz with Bashir by Ari Folman as well as INFRA, Max’s new score for The Royal Ballet, made with choreographer Wayne Macgregor and fine artist Julian Opie. He has also produced the score for the short animated film Lost and Found based upon the children’s book by Oliver Jeffers.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Meghan Elizabeth Trainor (born December 22, 1993) is an American singer, songwriter, and producer. She started writing songs when she was 11 and soon produced them on her computer 2 years later. At 18, Trainor signed a songwriting deal with Big Yellow Dog Music, penning tracks for Rascal Flatts and Disney star Sabrina Carpenter. In 2011, she wrote and self-released two albums, I'll Sing with You and Only 17.\n\nIn 2014, Trainor gained prominence with her debut single \"All About That Bass\", which reached number 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom.Trainor was born and raised in Nantucket, Massachusetts, the daughter of Gary and Kelli Trainor. She grew up with a musical family, and has been writing songs since she was 11 years old. She started a band with her family. When she was 13, her parents bought her a computer so that she could compose her own songs. The family later moved to Hyannis, Massachusetts, so that Trainor and her two brothers, Ryan and Justin, could attend Nauset Regional High School in nearby North Eastham.\nAt age 17, Trainor won the worldwide Sonicbids (2011) \"Tennessee Concerts Song Contest\" with her song You're Good With Me. She attended the Durango Songwriter's Expo and Big Al Anderson of NRBQ introduced her to Carla Wallace of Big Yellow Dog Music. Trainor signed as a songwriter with Big Yellow Dog Music shortly after her 18th birthday, while she was still in high school. In 2011, Trainor wrote and self-released two albums, I'll Sing With You and Only 17. She went on several writing trips to Los Angeles, New York City, and Nashville. She settled in Nashville full-time when she was 19. She has had songwriting cuts with Rascal Flatts, Sabrina Carpenter, R5, and many others. On one of Trainor's writing trips, she met and wrote with Grammy-nominated producer Kevin Kadish. They wrote \"All About That Bass\" in 2014, and Trainor's publishing company told her that many artists might be interested in recording the song. L.A. Reid heard Trainor's own demo of the song and signed her to Epic Records, where she was able to release the song as a solo artist. \"All About That Bass\" has since become her first #1 single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, and has topped charts in various other countries including Australia, Canada, Denmark and New Zealand. Trainor's EP, Title, was released in September 2014.\n\nOn September 28, 2014, the UK's Official Charts Company confirmed that Trainor's \"All About That Bass\" made chart history in the UK by becoming the first act to officially enter the Official Singles Chart Top 40 based on streams alone. The song then remained at the top of the UK chart for three weeks, becoming the longest-running number one by a female act in 2014.\n\nOn October 21, 2014, Trainor released the single \"Lips Are Movin\" to contemporary hit radio stations as the lead single from her upcoming third studio album Title, which is set to be released on January 13, 2015.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Michael Steven Bublé (boo-blay); born 9 September 1975) is a Canadian singer, songwriter and actor. He became a naturalized Italian citizen in 2005. He has won several awards, including four Grammy Awards and multiple Juno Awards.\nHis first album reached the top ten in Canada and the UK. He found a worldwide audience with his 2005 album It's Time, and his 2007 album Call Me Irresponsible which reached number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, the UK Albums Chart, the US Billboard 200 albums chart, the Australian ARIA Albums Chart and several European charts.\nBublé's 2009 album Crazy Love debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 after three days of sales, and remained there for two weeks. It was also his fourth number one album on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart. His 2011 holiday album, Christmas, was in first place on the Billboard 200 for the final four weeks of 2011 and the first week of 2012, totalling five weeks atop the chart, it also made the Top 5 in the United Kingdom. With this, Christmas became his third-consecutive number-one album on the chart. To Be Loved was released in April 2013.\nBublé was born in Burnaby, British Columbia to Lewis Bublé, a salmon fisherman, and Amber (née Santaga). He has two younger sisters, Brandee, a children's book author, and Crystal, an actress. The siblings were raised in the Roman Catholic faith. He attended Seaforth Elementary School and Cariboo Hill Secondary School.\nAccording to an Oprah interview on 9 October 2009, Bublé dreamed of becoming a famous singer since he was two years old. When he was a teenager, he slept with his Bible and prayed to become a singer. Bublé's interest in jazz music began around age five when his family played Bing Crosby's White Christmas album at Christmastime.\nThe first time his family noticed his singing talent was at Christmastime when Bublé was 13 years old, and they heard him powerfully sing the phrase \"May your days be merry and bright\" when the family was singing to the song \"White Christmas\" on a car ride.\nBublé had a strong passion for ice hockey and wanted to become a professional hockey player for the Vancouver Canucks growing up, but believed he was not good at it, stating: \"I wanted so bad to be a hockey player... If I was any good at hockey, I probably wouldn't be singing right now.\" Bublé often played hockey in his youth, watched Vancouver Canucks games with his father, and said that he \"went to every single home game as a kid... I remember I wanted to be Gary Lupul, I wanted to be Patrik Sundstrom and Ivan Hlinka. I used to think that being named Michael Bublé was pretty cool because I was close to being called Jiri Bubla.\" Bublé shared his hockey interest with his grandfather.\nFrom age 14, Bublé spent six years working during the summer as a commercial fisherman with his father and crewmates. Bublé described his work experience as \"The most deadly physical work I'll ever know in my lifetime. We’d be gone for two, sometimes three months at a time and the experience of living and working among guys over twice my age taught me a lot about responsibility and what it means to be a man.\"\nHis first singing engagements were in nightclubs at the age of 16 and were facilitated by his Italian grandfather Demetrio Santagà, a plumber originally from the small town of Preganziol, in the district of Treviso, who offered his plumbing services in exchange for stage time for his grandson. Bublé's grandfather paid for his singing lessons. One of his vocal instructors was Joseph Shore, the opera baritone. His maternal grandfather never stopped believing that he would become a star. Bublé's maternal grandmother, Iolanda (née Moscone), was also Italian, from Carrufo, Villa Santa Lucia degli Abruzzi, Italy. His father is also of Italian descent. His original brush with entertainment was as a children's entertainer using the name Mickey Bubbles.\nBublé grew up listening to his grandfather's collection of jazz records and credits his grandfather in encouraging his love for jazz music. \"My grandfather was really my best friend growing up. He was the one who opened me up to a whole world of music that seemed to have been passed over by my generation. Although I like rock 'n' roll and modern music, the first time my granddad played me the Mills Brothers, something magical happened. The lyrics were so romantic, so real, the way a song should be for me. It was like seeing my future flash before me. I wanted to be a singer and I knew that this was the music that I wanted to sing.\" Bublé never stopped believing he would become a star but admitted he was probably the only one who believed in his dream, stating that even his maternal grandfather thought Bublé was going to be \"an opening act for somebody in Las Vegas\". He stated he never learned to read and write music, using only emotion to drive his songwriting ability.\nAt the age of 18, Bublé entered a local talent contest and won. But after winning, he was disqualified by organizer Bev Delich because he was underage. After that, Delich entered Bublé in the Canadian Youth Talent Search, which he won. Following that win, Bublé asked Delich to be his manager. Delich signed on and represented Bublé for the next seven not-so-fruitful years. According to Delich, Bublé would do every gig imaginable, including talent shows, conventions, cruise ships, malls, hotel lounges, bars, clubs, corporate gigs, musical revues, singing telegrams, and even the occasional singing Santa Claus gig.\nIn 1996, Bublé appeared in TV's Death Game (aka Mortal Challenge) as a Drome Groupie. Also in 1996, he appeared (uncredited) in two episodes of The X-Files as a member of a submarine crew.\nBublé's first national TV performance was on a 1997 award-winning Bravo! documentary titled Big Band Boom!, directed by Mark Glover Masterson. Beginning in 1997, he became a frequent guest on Vicki Gabereau's national talk show on the CTV network. During its first season, the Vancouver-based program aired live, which ultimately worked in Bublé's favour. When a scheduled guest was forced to cancel, the show's music producer often asked Bublé to fill in at the last minute. The Gabereau appearances provided Bublé with great exposure, but they also helped the singer hone his television skills as a performer and as an interview guest. In a mutual show of gratitude, Bublé appeared on the final Gabereau show in 2005, along with Jann Arden and Elvis Costello.\nBublé received two Genie Award-nominations in 2000 for two songs he wrote for the film Here's to Life! (\"I've Never Been in Love Before\", \"Dumb ol' Heart\"). He recorded three independent albums (First Dance, 1996; Babalu, 2001; Dream, 2002).",

She achieved wide fame for her role as Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana on the Disney Channel sitcom Hannah Montana.\n\nCyrus recorded music for the soundtracks, Hannah Montana (2006) and Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus (2007), released by Walt Disney Records. With the success of the Hannah Montana franchise she established herself as a teen idol.\n\nIn 2007, Cyrus signed to Hollywood Records to pursue a solo career. She embarked upon the Best of Both Worlds Tour the same year, in which she performed as both herself and in character as Hannah Montana. The tour was eventually turned into a high-grossing concert film titled Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert (2008). In July 2008, Cyrus released her first solo album, Breakout (2008), which was commercially successful.\n\nShe began her foray into film by providing the voice of Penny in the animated film Bolt (2008). Cyrus earned a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for her performance of Bolt's theme song, \"I Thought I Lost You\". She also reprised her role as Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana in Hannah Montana: The Movie (2009). The Hannah Montana: The Movie' soundtrack introduced her to new audiences within country and adult contemporary markets.\n\nShe began to cultivate an adult image in 2009 with the release of The Time of Our Lives (2009), an extended play which presented a more mainstream pop sound, and by filming The Last Song (2010), a coming-of-age drama film. The former included Cyrus's best-selling single, \"Party in the U.S.A.\" (2009). A studio album titled Can't Be Tamed was released in 2010 and presents a new dance-pop sound. The music video and lyrics of the album's lead single, \"Can't Be Tamed\", portrays a more sexualized image for the entertainer. Cyrus ranked number thirteen on Forbes' 2010 Celebrity 100. For the 2011 Guinness World Records, she was named the “Most Charted Teenager” following her 29th US Billboard Hot 100 chart entry on November 7, 2009 with “Party in the USA”.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Miranda Leigh Lambert (born November 10, 1983) is an American country music artist who gained fame as a finalist on the 2003 season of Nashville Star, where she finished in third place and later signed to Epic Records. Lambert made her debut with the release of \"Me and Charlie Talking\", the first single from her 2005 debut album Kerosene. This album, which was certified Platinum in the United States, also produced the singles \"Bring Me Down\", \"Kerosene\", and \"New Strings\". All four singles were Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts.\n\nAfter Epic's Nashville division closed, Lambert was transferred to Columbia Records Nashville for her second album, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, which was released in early 2007. Although the title track failed to make top 40, the next three singles (\"Famous in a Small Town\", \"Gunpowder & Lead\", and \"More Like Her\") were all Top 20 hits, with \"Gunpowder & Lead\" becoming her first Top 10 country hit in July 2008. Lambert's third album, Revolution, was released in September 2009. Five singles have been released from the album, including Lambert's two Number One hits \"The House That Built Me,\" which spent four weeks at the top of the chart, and \"Heart Like Mine\". Lambert has also been honored by the Grammy Awards, the Academy of Country Music Awards, and the Country Music Association Awards.\n\nIn 2011, Lambert married fellow country singer Blake Shelton. She also released her fourth album, Four the Record, which includes the singles \"Baggage Claim\", \"Over You\" (also a number 1), \"Fastest Girl in Town\" and \"Mama's Broken Heart.\" Lambert also collaborated with Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley in the side project Pistol Annies. Miranda Leigh Lambert was born November 10, 1983 in Longview, Texas, and raised in Lindale, Texas. Her father, Richard Lee \"Rick\" Lambert, is a retired police officer who in later life became a private investigator in partnership with her mother, Beverly June Lambert (née Hughes). Miranda was taught about guns by her father at an early age and later became an avid deer hunter. Her parents took her to a Garth Brooks concert when she was nine and this started her interest in country music. Her father wrote and performed country music and she soon began singing in talent contests under his tutelage. She started her career playing in local restaurants.\n\nAt age sixteen, Lambert began appearing on the Johnnie High Country Music Revue in Arlington, Texas, the same show that helped launch the career of LeAnn Rimes. Lambert quickly landed a recording session in Nashville, but left the studio after she became frustrated with the \"pop\" sound of music. She then went back to Texas and asked her dad to teach her how to play guitar so she could write her own songs.\nWhile still in high school, Lambert made her professional singing debut with her band \"The Texas Pride Band.\"  fronted the house band at the Reo Palm Isle Ballroom in Longview, Texas, a long-running venue that has showcased Elvis Presley, Willie Nelson, and is where Brooks & Dunn started out as a bar room band.\n\nMelissa Maerz, writer for Entertainment Weekly, stated, “Lambert’s childhood provided her with rich material for her music.” When she turned fifteen, her family opened their home to an abused woman and her daughter. \"She had a black eye, and she was bawling,\" the singer remembers, her own eyes widening. \"I had heard about domestic abuse, but that was when it became real. Obviously, that influenced the 2008 hit 'Gunpowder and Lead.'\" Lambert is currently licensed to carry a handgun—on her forearm, there's a tattoo of two entwined revolvers emblazoned with angel wings—and she says that knowing she can defend herself makes her feel safe.”",

He is known for his raps, songs and choruses in both Dutch and English. Apart from being a performing artist himself, he is also active as song writer and producer.  In the hip hop scene Mr. Probz is known for the critically acclaimed songs 'Drivin', 'Who Are You' and 'Get My Props', a string of hits in his native language in The Netherlands and many collaborations with well known hip hop artists in the United States. Despite offers to sign with record labels, both in The Netherlands and in the US, Mr. Probz decided to keep building a strong foundation in Europe as an independent artist.  Mr. Probz had been creatively active since a young age, already occupying himself with graffiti as a youngster and writing lyrics about his every day experiences. At a young age he was faced with the typical trials and tribulations of inner city youth growing up, spending large portions of his time on the streets and viewing his music as the one path out of a life of poverty and crime.  August 6 th 2010, Mr. Probz got shot down in the centre of Amsterdam. In the hospital the popular hip hop artist received massive attention from the Dutch media and support from fellow musicians and fans. Within days after his release from the hospital, Mr. Probz was already back to focusing on his music. Half a year after the accident, the Dutch hit song 'Meisje Luister' of him and Kleine Viezerik was a #1 hit at the FunX Hip Hop Chart.  In 2010 Mr. Probz was nominated for a BNN/State Award in the category 'Best Artist'. He was the first unsigned artist to get this nomination in the award show's history.  In the Dutch motion picture 'Bolletjes Blues' Mr. Probz plays the role of lead character Jimmy. 'Bolletjes Blues' was the first Dutch hip hop film.  In his career Mr. Probz recorded and worked closely with artists like Alchemist, Joell Ortiz, Joe Budden, Scott Storch, Yukmouth, Grafh, Raekwon, Royce da 5'9 and Giorgio Tuinfort (Konvict Music), among many others.  Currently Mr. Probz is readying his debut album, called 'The Treatment'.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 - February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat King Cole, was an American musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. He owes most of his popular musical fame to his soft baritone voice, which he used to perform in big band and jazz genres. He was one of the first black Americans to host a television variety show, and has maintained worldwide popularity since his death.\nNathaniel Adams Coles was born in Montgomery, Alabama, on Saint Patrick's Day (March 17) in 1919. When he was 4, he and his family moved to Chicago, Illinois, where his father, Edward Coles, became a Baptist minister. Cole learned to play the organ from his mother, Perlina Coles, the church organist. His first performance was of \"Yes! We Have No Bananas\" at age four. He began formal lessons at 12, eventually learning not only jazz and gospel music, but also European classical music, performing, as he said, \"from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff\".\nCole had three brothers: Eddie, Ike, and Freddy Coles. His half-sister, Joyce Coles, married Robert Doak, of Robert Doak & Associates, Inc., art suppliers.\nThe family lived in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. Cole would sneak out of the house and hang around outside the clubs, listening to artists such as Louis Armstrong, Earl Hines, and Jimmie Noone. He participated in Walter Dyett's renowned music program at DuSable High School.\nInspired by the performances of Earl Hines, Cole began his performing career in the mid 1930s while still a teenager, adopting the name \"Nat Cole\". His older brother, Eddie, a bass player, soon joined Cole's band, and they made their first recording in 1936 under Eddie's name. They also were regular performers at clubs. Cole, in fact, acquired his nickname, \"King\", performing at one jazz club, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He also was a pianist in a national tour of Broadway theatre legend Eubie Blake's revue, \"Shuffle Along\". When it suddenly failed in Long Beach, California, Cole decided to remain there. He would later return to Chicago in triumph to play such venues as the famed Edgewater Beach Hotel.",

In 2005 she released Casa, her second CD, but this time as Natalia y La Forquetina (the name of her band).  Since she was very young, Natalia had a great interest in music, partly because her parents were musicians. At three years old she began to sing and at four, she realized that she wanted to be an artist.  She attended Instituto Anglo Español, a Catholic middle school. In her childhood and adolescence she studied painting, flute, theater, music, acting, piano, guitar, saxophone and singing. When she was 10, Natalia sang in a Mariachi group.  She lived many years in Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico, where she studied music with her mother, imitating artists like Gloria Trevi and Garibaldi.  In 1998, Natalia was part of an all-girl trio called Twist. Unfortunately, the group was unsuccessful and they split up the next year.  Soon after, she began preparing to be a solo artist. When Natalia was 17, Loris Ceroni gave her the opportunity to be in a pop/rock group under his guidance, but when she wasn't sure, he encouraged her to go solo.  Although LaFourcade didn't join the group, Loris Ceroni produced her first LP under the label of Sony Music. It was recorded in Italy and was cowritten with Aureo Baqueiro. Sabo Romo played in 2 songs. Natalia Lafourcade's music is a mix of pop, rock, bossa-nova and latin rhythms. It features the songs Busca un Problema, Elefantes, Mirame, Mirate and her biggest hit: En el 2000.  In 2003, she was nominated for a Latin Grammy in the Best New Artist category (she lost to David Bisbal) for her debut album. Also, she collaborated on the soundtrack of the Mexican movie Amarte Duele.  In 2005 she released Casa, her second CD, but this time as Natalia y La Forquetina (the name of her band).",

Beginning his career as a songwriter, Ne-Yo penned the hit \"Let Me Love You\" for singer Mario. The single's successful release in the United States prompted an informal meeting between Ne-Yo and Def Jam's label head, and the signing of a recording contract. He has won three Grammy Awards for his musical work.\n\nIn 2006, he released his debut album, In My Own Words, which contained the US number one hit \"So Sick\", as well as the top 10 hit Sexy Love. In 2007, he released his second album, Because of You, which contained the US top 3 hit, Because of You. In 2008, he released his third album, Year of the Gentleman, which contained the top 10 hits Closer, Mad and Miss Independent. His fourth studio album, Libra Scale, was released on November 22, 2010. It received critical acclaim from music critics, but was a commercial disappointment, debuting at number nine on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling less than all of his previous three studio albums. In 2009, Billboard ranked him as the 57th Artist of the 2000s decade. In addition to a successful recording career, Ne-Yo has amassed a catalog of chart-topping songs that he has written for other artists.",

Following the release of their fourth studio album, Lines, Vines and Trying Times (2009), the Jonas Brothers confirmed a hiatus.

Their debut album, Summer's Gone, was released in 2012 to much acclaim in the underground electronic music community. Following Summer's Gone, Odesza released their first EP in 2013 entitled, My Friends Never Die. \n\nHistory:\nHarrison Mills and Clayton Knight met during their freshman year at Western Washington University. However, they did not begin collaborating musically until their senior year in 2012. As a child, Knight was classically trained in piano and later learned guitar. The duo quickly released their debut LP, Summer's Gone, on September 5 later that year. Their debut EP, My Friends Never Die, was released a year later. Odesza was booked to open for Pretty Lights on his Analog Future Tour in the fall of 2013. \nOdesza derive their name from Mills' uncle's ship, which sank. Only his uncle and one other crew mate survived. They also claim that the name is a variant of \"Odessa\", however that spelling was already in use by another band. Therefore they settled on replacing one \"s\" with a \"z\".",

        "strBiographyEN" : "There are at least three artists with that name:  1) Omi (real name Omar Samuel Pasley) was born on September 3, 1986 in Clarendon, Jamaica. He is the last of four children of Kenroy and Rachel Pasley.  As a child growing up, he sang at every occasion that provided an audience - the church, school concerts or any other community gathering. Much to the delight of his onlookers, Omi would rise to the occasion once he got the opportunity.  Omi idolized his father and nurtured the desire to follow in his footstep as a visual artist and musician. For him, this was no easy feat to accomplish, as his dad was not only outstanding at painting portraits, but also a great musician known in the industry as Jah Ken. However, before Jah Ken could pass on all he knew about both vocations, he died of emphysema when Omi was only nine years old. His dad's passing left a vacuum in his world and as young as he was, Omi pledged to use his talents to keep his family anchored together.   He attended the May Pen Primary School, before moving to the Garvey Maceo High School where he started to shine as a true performer among his friends. Omi was captivated by the beats and 'raw street poetry' that coloured the hip-hop music genre, so much so, that during class breaks, his peers would take turns belting hip-hop beats while he rapped. His friends were fascinated with the cutting edge lyrics he trilled and voiced their approval by drumming on the desks and chairs, while maintaining the rhythm to the lyrics he spun. It was at that moment Omi realized he could effortlessly create catchy melodies. As he grew older and his voice became more distinct, he also found singing more to his liking. He enjoyed the latitude it gave him in putting more \"soul\" and creativity into his compositions.   Omi is the newest prodigy for international talent wizard, Clifton 'Specialist' Dillon who successfully produced and marketed such luminaries as Shabba Ranks, Patra and Italian reggae singer Alborosie. Omi is a prolific singer and songwriter inspired by stars such as Nat King Cole, John Legend and Tanya Stephens. He enjoys reasoning on social, cultural and spiritual issues from which he solicits material to incorporate in the body of his songs. The timbre of his voice is smooth, bright and compelling. Omi's fluid vocal delivery and his contemporary song writing skills will no doubt secure successive hits on both local and international charts.  Omi is being groomed in all aspects of the music business under the direction of the Shang Records Label, spearheaded by Clifton 'Specialist' Dillon. He is currently in the studio laying tracks for his debut album, for which intro singles Standing On All Threes, and Cheerleader will be released shortly.   2) Omri Harpaz (Omi), was born in 1977 in Israel, Studied computer programming and his goal is to one day rule the universe. Omi was attracted to electronic music ever since he can remember. Omi started Djing at the age of 17 and since then played all over the world (Japan, Mexico, Kenya, Holland, Germany, Portugal and in the Usa).  In the last few years, Omi started producing music. He started off with his project \"Digital Manta\" which was more progressive orientated, but after a while his style transformed to the more full on side of trance and he began his new project called \"40%\".  In his music Omi aims to the dance floor and his mission is to get the crowds up dancing, digging and kicking. For the past two years, Omi has joined \"Shulman\" producing psybiant, music that they have preformed all over the world.  Omi has collaborated with many other artists as well including: Exaile, Skazi, Beat on Phobia, Blt and more.  3) Omi (real name Juan Omar Ruiz Martínez) was born in Alicante (Spain) in 1988. Naturally talented, willing to learn and to work hard he rapidly developped and used his musical competences to produce his own music and find his own style. In 2004 he started producing electronic music and as he got to discover various musical styles he found himself particularly interested in foreign hardcore techno music.  Once he discovered hardcore music he rapidly started to produce his own and it's with the netlabel PNZZ that his reputation started to grow. In 2009 with his first song released on vinyl with Megarave Records, he made his first step in the scene and since then his passion and willingness to succeed in this highly competitive sphere kept on getting bigger.  In 2011 he impressed DJ Promo with an innovative banging demo and he signed a contract with TTM, a significant result for this young artist.  A melancholic feeling mixed with drums, great strenght and forcefuleness, that's how you can describe Omi's melodies. With no restriction when it comes to production, Omi is comfortable with the most commercial as much as with the roughest industrial sound. His ability to combine various styles is what makes his strenght when it comes to mixing.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Omar Samuel Pasley (born 3 September 1986), better known by his stage name Omi (/ˈoʊmiː/ oh-mee), is a Jamaican singer. He is best known for \"Cheerleader\", a worldwide hit for him in a remixed version by German DJ Felix Jaehn. He is currently signed to Ultra Music, a part of Sony Music, and released his debut album Me 4 U on 16 October 2015.\n\nOmar Samuel Pasley was born in the parish of Clarendon, Jamaica, and moved to Rochester, New York with his aunt, at 15 years of age. At age 18 he moved back to Jamaica after his aunt's death. Omi established in Kingston, after being discovered by the dancehall impresario Clifton Dillon (known as Specialist) and signed to Oufah, an independent Jamaican label. His first recorded single was \"Standing On All Threes\" released with a music video. Omi had composed his future hit song \"Cheerleader\" in 2008. He eventually recorded it and performed and released in 2012. It was released in Jamaica along with a low-budget, high-concept video shot in Oregon during OMI's first trip to the United States, becoming a modest hit in Jamaica and also popular in Hawaii and in Dubai. Never releasing an album, Omi had various local hits in Jamaica like \"Take It Easy\", \"Fireworks\" (accompanied by a music video) and \"Color of My Lips\", the latter featuring Busy Signal, a well-known Jamaican dancehall, ska, and reggae artist.\n\nIn 2014, \"Cheerleader\" got a second life when Patrick Moxey, the president of Ultra Music, a dance label partly owned by Sony Music heard the song and liked it offering to remix the song and relaunch it as a dance track. In early 2014, Ultra Music commissioned two remixes for the song, one by Ricky Blaze and the other by Felix Jaehn, a 20-year-old German producer. Eventually Ultra Music opted for the airy tropical house version of \"Cheerleader\" as remixed by Jaehn. The remix initially became a huge hit in Sweden, eventually certified 5 times platinum. Soon the song spread through other European charts, notably France, Italy and Germany. It topped the charts in several European countries and in Australia. In the United Kingdom, Omi made history on May 24, 2015, when \"Cheerleader\" topped the UK Singles Chart for a fourth week in a row, marking the longest consecutive period any Jamaican artist has held that position on the chart. In the United States, the song entered the Billboard Hot 100 in May 2015; it later made the top spot of the Hot 100 after 12 weeks in the chart. Claiming the top spot, OMI has achieved recognition worldwide. On August 27, 2015 he released the single \"Hula Hoop\". He released his debut studio album Me 4 U on 16 October 2015. The album includes the singles \"Cheerleader\", \"Hula Hoop\", \"Stir It\", and \"Drop In the Ocean\".",

        "strBiographyEN" : "One Ok Rock (stylized as ONE OK ROCK) is a Japanese rock band formed in 2005, composed of Taka, Toru, Ryota, and Tomoya. Originally a five piece band, guitarist Alex left the group in 2009.\n\nThe band had various singles that entered the Oricon charts and their songs are gradually gaining popularity online, catapulting them as one of the most promising rock artists in Asia.\n\nThe foundation for One Ok Rock began when Toru Yamashita, then a high school student, wanted to start a band. He told his friend Ryota Kohama, a fellow member of the hip hop dance group Heads, to learn the bass and asked Alex Onizawa to join. After seeing Taka Moriuchi perform in a cover band, Toru insisted that he join. Drummer Tomoya Kanki had been playing with them since 2006, but only became an official member when they debuted in 2007.\n\nThe band's name, One Ok Rock, comes from \"one o'clock\", the time that the band used to practice on weekends. However, noticing that the  made no distinction between r's and l's, they changed \"o'clock\" to \"o'crock\" (or \"o'krock\"), which was then separated to become \"ok rock\".\n\nOn April 5, 2009, Alex was arrested for groping the leg of a twenty-one-year-old female student on a train. He admitted to the charges and the case was settled out of court. However, the band's next single \"Around the World Shounen\", which was planned for a May 6 release and to be used as the theme song for the TV drama God Hand Teru, and their nationwide tour were both cancelled. In May 2009, it was announced that One Ok Rock would continue without Alex.\n\nThe band released the single \"Kanzen Kankaku Dreamer\" on February 3, 2010. It reached 9th on the Weekly Oricon Chart. They released their fourth studio album titled Niche Syndrome on June 9, 2010. Their next single, \"Answer is Near\", was released on February 16, 2011.\n\nThe band released their first double A-side single \"Re:make/No Scared\" on July 20, 2011, the latter song being the main theme for the Black Rock Shooter: The Game video game. The band's fifth album, Zankyo Reference, was released on October 5, 2011. Their latest single, \"The Beginning\", which is used as a theme for the live action movie adaptation of the Rurouni Kenshin manga, was released on August 22, 2012.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "One Direction are a British-Irish boy band formed in London in 2010, consisting of members Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson. They signed to Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records after being formed and placing third in the seventh series of British television music competition The X Factor. They later signed in North America to Columbia Records.\nBuoyed by the international chart-topping debut single, \"What Makes You Beautiful\", One Direction's debut studio album, Up All Night (2011), topped charts around the world. It became the UK's fastest-selling debut album of 2011 and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, making One Direction the first British group in US chart history to debut at number one with their first album. In 2012, \"What Makes You Beautiful\" won the BRIT Award for Best British Single. One Direction supported the album with their Up All Night Tour. One Direction's 2013 World Tour is set to run for most of 2013, with tickets grossing $15.7 million for their Australian and New Zealand dates, and is set to be preceded by their second studio album, Take Me Home, which is scheduled for release in November 2012.\nOne Direction have been described as sparking a resurgence in the boy band concept, and of forming part of a new \"British Invasion\" in the United States. As of June 2012, according to Nick Gatfield, the chairman and chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment UK, One Direction represent a $50 million business empire. Their work has earned them awards and nominations. One Direction have supported various charities and foundations, and have commercial endorsements with Pokémon, Nokia, HarperCollins and Hasbro. They also appeared as themselves in the iCarly episode \"iGo One Direction\" (2012).\nIn 2010, Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson auditioned as solo candidates for the seventh series of British television music competition The X Factor. Failing to progress to the \"Boys\" category at \"judges' houses\", after a suggestion by guest judge Nicole Scherzinger, they were put together to form a five-piece boy band at Wembley Arena, London, England, July 2010, during the \"bootcamp\" stage of the competition, thus qualifying for the \"Groups\" category. Subsequently, the group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practise. Styles came up with the name One Direction as he thought it would sound good when The X Factor announcer read their name out on the live shows. For their qualifying song at \"judges' houses\", and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of \"Torn\". In the live shows, after the elimination of F.Y.D., Diva Fever and Belle Amie within four weeks, they were Simon Cowell's last act in the competition. The group quickly gained popularity in the UK. One Direction finished in third place behind runner-up Rebecca Ferguson and winner Matt Cardle. Immediately after the final, their song \"Forever Young\", which would have been released if they had won The X Factor, was leaked onto the internet. Shortly afterwards it was confirmed, One Direction had been signed by Cowell to a Â£2 million Syco Records record contract. Recording for their debut album began in January 2011, as they flew to Los Angeles to work with producer RedOne. In February 2011, One Direction and nine other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour. The tour saw the group performing for 500,000 people throughout the UK. After the tour concluded in April 2011, the group continued working on their debut album, recording took place in Sweden, UK, and the United States, as One Direction worked with producers Carl Falk, Savan Kotecha, Steve Mac, and Rami Yacoub, among others.",

They were originally known as Two Shades Deep but later changed the group's name to OutKast. The group's original musical style was a mixture of Dirty South and G-funk. Since then, however, funk, soul, rock, electronic music, spoken word poetry, jazz and blues elements have been added to the group's musical palette.\nAfter forming the group as high school students in 1992, Outkast released its debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik (1994), which gained popularity after the single \"Player's Ball\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart. The duo released ATLiens in 1996, which displayed stylistic differences from the band's debut and featured outer space-inspired themes. The albums Aquemini (1998) and Stankonia (2000) further expanded Outkast's musical experimentation. In 2003, the duo released a double album entitled Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which featured the number one singles \"Hey Ya!\" and \"The Way You Move\". The group starred in and created the soundtrack for the 2006 musical film Idlewild. Since 2007, Outkast has been on hiatus and both members have pursued solo careers, although the group moved to Epic Records in September 2011.\nThe duo is one of the most successful hip-hop groups of all time, having received six Grammy Awards. Over 25 million copies have been sold of OutKast's eight releases: five studio albums, a greatest hits release, and the Grammy Award-winning (for Album of the Year) Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, a double album containing a solo album from each member. Along with their commercial success, OutKast has maintained an experimental approach in their music and are widely praised for their originality and artistic content.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Juan Carlos Ozuna Rosado (born March 13, 1992), known by his stage name Ozuna, is a Puerto Rican reggaeton and Latin trap singer, having released many hits such as \"Si No Te Quiere\", \"No Quiere Enamorarse\", \"Dile Que Tu Me Quieres\", \"Te Vas\", \"Tu Foto\", \"El Farsante\", \"Se Preparó\", \"Quiero Repetir\", \"Síguelo Bailando\", and \"La Modelo\", and having been featured on several hits from the genre, most notably on De La Ghetto’s \"La Ocasión\", Bad Bunny’s \"Diles\", Daddy Yankee's \"La Rompe Corazones\", Chris Jeday’s \"Ahora Dice\", Wisin’s \"Escápate Conmigo\", Romeo Santos’s \"Sobredosis\", Alex Sensation’s \"Que Va\", Natti Natasha’s \"Criminal\", Reik’s \"Me Niego\", and the remixed version of \"Te Boté\".\n\nCareer\nEarly life\nOzuna was born in San Juan to a Dominican father and a Puerto Rican mother. As stated in the eponymous intro song from his album Odisea, he grew up very poor and was mainly raised by his paternal grandmother; his father, who worked as a dancer for reggaeton pioneer Vico C for three years, was fatally shot when Ozuna was only three, and his mother wasn't financially stable enough to raise him. Throughout the 2000s decade and during his college career in New York City, he found great inspiration for his musical career.\n\nBeginnings\nOzuna began writing songs at age 13. He made his debut as a singer in 2012 with the song \"Imaginando\". He previously went by the name J Oz. He worked with Musicologo & Menes and gained popularity.\n\nIn 2014, he signed a recording contract with Golden Family Records and began to publish his songs on YouTube. In that same year, he started his ongoing popular streak with the song \"Si No Te Quiere\", originally featuring rapper D.OZi. This song was a big success on the radio, and was eventually well known across Latin America. He has since performed in many shows across South America. Today, Ozuna enjoys great success and popularity as an artist across Latin America.\n\nBreakthrough\nIn the beginning of 2016, Ozuna became well known for his appearance in the single \"La Ocasión\", a collaboration with DJ Luian, Mambo Kingz, De La Ghetto, Arcángel and Anuel AA. The single reached number 22 on the Hot Latin Songs chart. In March, Ozuna released a remix of his song \"No Quiere Enamorarse\", featuring Daddy Yankee. In September, he released his most popular single to date, \"Dile Que Tú Me Quieres\", which earned him a place at number 13 on the Billboard Latin chart at the end of the year. Ozuna also had two other songs make it on this list: \"Si Tu Marido No Te Quiere (Remix)\" (featuring Arcángel and Farruko) and \"En La Intimidad\", which reached the top 30.\n\nIn 2017, his album Odisea was released. The single \"Te Vas\" reached more than 650 million views on YouTube, making it Ozuna's most popular song on social media. Despite his short tenure in the urban genre, Ozuna has become remarkably successful, managing to release numerous songs that quickly become viral hits. As a result, many important figures in the genre consider Ozuna to be one of the best artists and the most successful of the new generation of reggaeton artists.\n\nIn 2017, Ozuna released many singles, including \"Dile Que Tu Me Quieres (Remix)\" (featuring Yandel), \"Después de las 12\" and, in April of that year, \"Tu Foto\", which reached the 10th spot on the Latin Billboard list, and reached more than 720 million views on YouTube. He also released several collaboration songs, including \"La Rompe Corazones\" (featuring Daddy Yankee), \"Escápate Conmigo\" (featuring Wisin), \"Ahora Dice\" (with J Balvin, Arcángel and Chris Jeday) among others. \"Se Preparó\" was released on August 10, 2017 and, as of August 2018, has more than 880 million views on YouTube.\n\nIn December 2017, Ozuna released the single \"La Modelo\" featuring Cardi B. Following the release, the song debuted at number 52 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the chart dated January 6, 2018, (becoming Ozuna's first entrance to the ranking as a lead act, following his featurings with Wisin's \"Escápate Conmigo\" and Natti Natasha's \"Criminal\") which all of them hit at number three on the Hot Latin Songs chart.\n\nAward shows and nominations\nIn 2017, Ozuna won the category of Best Breakthrough Artist at the Premios Juventud. He won the category of Best New Latin Artist at the 2018 iHeartRadio Music Awards. Ozuna became the 2018 Billboard Music Award Top Latin Artist of the Year winner and the Billboard Latin Music Award Artist of the Year.\n\nMusical style\nOzuna is part of the newest wave of urban singers coming out of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and has a deep friendship with the controversial rapper Anuel AA. Ozuna has had more than 10 songs exceed 200 million views on YouTube, echoing the beginnings of other successful urban artists, like Farruko and Maluma. While many of his songs feature explicit sexual lyrics, he has avoided lyrics that explicitly objectify or disrespect women - one of the few in the Latin Trap genre to do so - out of respect for his wife, Taina, and daughter, Sofia. As described by a The New York Times article, Ozuna \"can work across all these genres at the same time is a testament to the current fluidity of Latin pop, but also to the effectiveness of his singing. He has a sweet, nimble voice that he sometimes deploys like a balladeer, and sometimes like a rapper.\"\n\nTouring\nOzuna performed his first official tour, \"Odisea Tour\", which began on May 26 2017, in Atlanta, Georgia, and traveled more than 25 cities in the United States. Ozuna has announced the dates for his Aura U.S. tour 2018 which will include more than 29 cities.",

After her three-year career with the contemporary R&B girl group Choice, in 2000 she released her first single \"There You Go,\" from her debut album Can't Take Me Home. The song garnered commercial success, peaking at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2001, she released her second, more pop rock-oriented, studio album, Missundaztood. The album went on to become a critical and commercial success, with estimated sales of 13 million.

The album was, commercially, less successful than her previous album, but still managed to sell around 3 million copies, making it Pink's least successful album to date. It produced three singles, \"Trouble,\" \"God Is a DJ\" and \"Last to Know,\" with the first receiving a Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. After taking a short break, she released I'm Not Dead, her fourth studio album, on April 4, 2006. It marked her comeback after the poor performance of her previous album. The album debuted and peaked at #6 on the Billboard 200, Pink's highest debut on the chart. It was preceded by the controversial single, \"Stupid Girls\", which garnered commercial success. The second single, \"Who Knew,\" was virtually ignored on American radio, but after the huge success of \"U + Ur Hand,\" was re-released, peaking at #9 on the charts. \"U + Ur Hand\" is credited to have revived Pink's career in the US, and also to have brought the album back to the charts. Her fifth album, Funhouse, was released in late October 2008. It was preceded by her first solo number one on the Billboard Hot 100, \"So What.\" The album notched three other Top 20 hits: \"Sober,\" \"Please Don't Leave Me\" and \"Glitter in the Air.\" On November 15, 2010, she released her first compilation album, Greatest Hits... So Far!!!. The album produced two singles, \"Raise Your Glass\" and \"Fuckin' Perfect,\" the former reaching the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100.

A few months later, in June 2010, Forbes magazine named Pink the 27th most powerful celebrity in the world. Pink's career accomplishments include three Grammy Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards and two Brit Awards. In June 2011 Pink and her husband, Carey Hart, welcomed their first child, Willow Sage. As of January 2012, Pink has sold over 40 million albums and 70 million singles worldwide, making her one of the best-selling artists of all time.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Passenger was formed in 1995 by Sten and Engelin. Both members wanted to do something that was not Thrash metal or Melodic death metal unlike the bands they played in. At its early stages the band was originally called Cliff. Under the name Cliff they recorded two demos in Studio Fredman that were never released. After a break in the band and after Engelin was hired as a session guitarist for In Flames' Whoracle tour, Anders Fridén, the vocalist of In Flames showed interest in Passenger and joined the band.\nIn the year 2000 the band came back from its break and went on to record a demo. In 2001 the band recorded another demo in which early versions of the songs \"Used\", \"In My Head\", \"Circus\" and \"Drowning City\" were recorded. After a third demo the band finally recorded and released their debut album entitled Passenger. A video for \"In Reverse\" was also released.\nSten noted in February 2004 on their official website that they were in the process of recording their second album. However, since then, Fridén, lead vocalist of both Passenger and In Flames has been noted saying that he has very little time for the project, due to other commitments, and the group has split up as a result. In an interview with Fridén he stated that as soon as he gets a break from In Flames, he wants to get all the group together to record a second album for early 2010. This however, did not happen as Anders continued touring with In Flames until October 2010 when they entered their studio to record their next album. As of 2013, a decade after the band released their self-titled debut album, there has not been any activity in regards to regrouping. However, an interview with Unsung Melody, Fridén has admitted that it has been thought about.",

Previously the main vocalist and songwriter of Passenger, Rosenberg opted to keep the band's name for his solo work after the band dissolved in 2009. His most successful single, \"Let Her Go\", has topped the charts in many countries.\nRosenberg was born on 17 May 1984 in Brighton & Hove, East Sussex, England to an English mother and an American father, Gerard Rosenberg, originally from Vineland, New Jersey. His father's family is Jewish. Rosenberg learned classical guitar at a young age, and around 14–15 started to write songs. He did not apply himself at school in Brighton, spending his time on music. Rosenberg left school at the age of 16 to pursue a career in the music industry and spent the next few years as a busker in England and Australia. Rosenberg still lives in Brighton.\nRosenberg’s father (a film production worker) introduced him to ex-Faithless member Jamie Catto in 2001, leading to a two-song spot at the Free Burma Campaign benefit gig at the Royal Court in London in 2002. On the night, Rosenberg met his future writing partner Andrew Phillips and established contact with the IE Music label. Back in Brighton, Phillips and Rosenberg pooled their musical influences (from Simon And Garfunkel to DJ Shadow), and started to write songs at Phillips’ in-house studio in Hove. During 2003 they formed the Mike Rosenberg Band, engaging Marcus O’Dair (bass), Alon Cohen (drums) and Richard Brinklow (keyboards) through connections within the Brighton music scene.",

The urge to interpret his lyrics outside of a recording studio led him to improvise and rap in Argentinian squares with friends, gradually creating a local buzz. Leaving his comfort zone and freestyling in squares helped with his shyness, and launched a competitive period spanning around five years. He forged his style battling in freestyle contests as the so-called El Quinto Escalón, and rapidly stepped up to Latin trap.\nHis professional career kicked off with \"Relax\", a song he uploaded in early 2017. Londra's music avoids themes prominent in urban music, such as violence and drugs.\nLondra became to be known after his hit-songs \"Nena Maldición\", featuring Lenny Tavarez; \"Te Amo\", with Piso 21; and \"Cuando Te Besé\", with Becky G. The latter peaked at number 45 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs and became the first song to ever top the Billboard Argentina Hot 100.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Vocal sensations and winners of season 3 of NBC’s The Sing-Off, Pentatonix are taking instrument-free music far beyond anyone’s wildest expectations. Named after the world’s most widely recognized five-note musical scale, this vocal quintet has transformed one of pop music’s purest and most soulful expressions into an exciting future, filled with limitless sonic possibility. Pairing their intricate arrangements with cleverly re-imagined pop songs, Pentatonix have quickly cultivated a sound and style that is entirely unique and undeniably infectious.\n\nPentatonix is comprised of lead vocalists Scott Hoying (21), Kirstie Maldonado (20) and Mitch Grassi (20), vocal bass Avi Kaplan (23) and beatboxer Kevin “K.O.” Olusola (24) and, while the individuals would maintain that each of their fellow band members is irreplaceable, the fact remains that 24-hours before their audition for The Sing-Off they still hadn’t all officially met.\n\nA freshman at The University of Southern California, Scott decided to audition for the show and enlisted childhood friends and fellow Arlington, Texas-natives Kirstie and Mitch. As a high school vocal trio, they had found success both locally and online thanks to their cover of Lady Gaga’s “Telephone.” Determined to add depth and a distinctive dynamic to the group, Scott set out to add more vocalists, first adding Avi, who’d built himself a reputation as one of the most talented vocal basses in Southern California, and eventually took to YouTube where he found the video for “Julie-O,” featuring Kevin’s cello-boxing (simultaneously beatboxing and performing the song on his cello).\n\nFinally a fully formed group, Pentatonix perfected their sound (and their chemistry) throughout the season, naturally developing a signature style and a knack for arranging songs that pulled equally from the five individuals’ strengths. Despite drawing from a dizzyingly eclectic set of musical genres – the group cites pop, jazz, r&b, indie, folk, dubstep and electronica as just a few of their inspirations – the quintet seemed to mesh magically, evident in their modern interpretation of The Buggles’ “Video Killed The Radio Star,” or their epic adaptation of Florence and the Machines’ “The Dog Days Are Over.” Before long, Pentatonix had become a legitimate musical force, armed with a collective confidence and swagger that would eventually propel them to win the competition.\n\nPentatonix – who have all relocated to Los Angeles – have continued to build upon their already fiercely loyal fanbase, introducing a slew of new material via their YouTube channel, including covers of Gotye’s “Somebody That I Used To Know,” Fun’s “We Are Young,” and Psy’s “Gangnam Style.” The three videos – featured by Perez Hilton, The Huffington Post, RyanSeacrest.com and Nightline – have eclipsed 17 million views, collectively, while the channel has quickly reached 30 million views, buoyed by its roughly 250,000 subscribers.",

He is best known as the drummer and lead singer in the rock band Genesis and as a solo artist. Between 1983 and 1990, Collins scored three UK and seven US number-one singles in his solo career. When his work with Genesis, his work with other artists, as well as his solo career is totalled, Collins had more US top 40 singles than any other artist during the 1980s. His most successful singles include \"In the Air Tonight\", \"Against All Odds\", \"Sussudio\" and \"Another Day in Paradise\".\nBorn and raised in west London, Collins played drums from the age of five and completed drama school training, which secured him various roles as a child actor. He then pursued a music career, joining Genesis in 1970 as their drummer and becoming lead singer in 1975 following the departure of Peter Gabriel. Collins began a solo career in the 1980s, initially inspired by his marital breakdown and love of soul music, releasing a series of successful albums, including Face Value (1981), No Jacket Required (1985) and ...But Seriously (1989). Collins became \"one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond\". He also became known for a distinctive gated reverb drum sound on many of his recordings. After leaving Genesis in 1996, Collins pursued various solo projects before a return in 2006 for the Turn It On Again Tour. In 2011, he retired to focus on his family life, but continued to write songs. He announced his return to the music industry in 2015.\nCollins' discography includes eight studio albums that have sold 33.5 million certified units in the US and an estimated 150 million worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling artists. He is one of three recording artists, along with Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson, who have sold over 100 million albums worldwide both as solo artists and separately as principal members of a band.

        "strBiographyEN" : "The French group Phoenix draw elements from their eclectic '80s upbringing to arrive at a satisfying synthesis of rock and synthesizers. Vocalist Thomas Mars, bassist Deck d'Arcy, and guitarist Christian Mazzalai were a garage band based out of Mars' house in the suburbs of Paris. Mazzalai's older brother Branco joined the band on guitar when his band Darlin' disbanded in 1995.\nThe group got its touring start on the French bar circuit doing Hank Williams and Prince covers to drunken audiences. Two years later the band took on the name Phoenix and pressed 500 copies of a single on its own label, Ghettoblaster. The A-side was a punk rock song and the other a chugging Krautrocker, hinting at their eclectic tastes. Shortly after, they were signed to the Paris-based Source Records. Phoenix became well acquainted with labelmates Air when they acted as their backing band on several U.K. TV appearances. The result of the electronic exposure was a single called \"Heatwave,\" which was very similar in approach to '70s disco.\n\nUnited, the group's debut album, appeared in 2000 on Astralwerks and was recorded over two months. The album featured guest appearances from friends and family, including Thomas Bangalter (Daft Punk), Philippe Zdar (Cassius), and d'Arcy's mother's choral society on the track \"Funky Squaredance.\" From that point, they issued Alphabetical (2004), It's Never Been Like That (2006), and their mainstream breakthrough, the critically adored Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (2009). Part of the extended break between the third and fourth albums was due to Mars becoming a father (with his partner, director Sofia Coppola).",

        "strBiographyEN" : "A Romanian folk rock / rock band, who has experimented across the years with many musical genres, having a rich musical history that can easily be compared to that of the Beatles. Starting with the rock'n'roll of the Beat Generation, they continued enriching their sound with blues influences, jazz, psychedelic, krautrock, culminating with the orientation towards Romanian folk music, which they blended harmoniously with the sound that was popular in the '70s  Phoenix is one of the most prominent Romanian Rock and Roll bands of the latest decades, and also the first one to take musical inspiration from ancient Romanian folk themes.  Formed in the 1960s, it began by doing covers of Beatles songs. However, they soon had to change their style since the Romanian communist regime disliked any form of western culture. The communist regime suggested that all rock oriented bands should look for inspiration within the Romanian culture. These restrictions made the band's leader Nicolae Covaci search within the Romanian folklore, which gave them a unique sound.  The beginning  Phoenix was launched in the cosmopolitan city of Timişoara in 1962 by a pair of schoolboys: Nicu Covaci and Béla Kamocsa, under the name of Sfinţii (The Saints). In their first years, together with Florin \"Moni\" Bordeianu (born 1948), they performed in school contests and at local clubs, covering Western music hits from The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Who, etc., and they quickly became very popular amongst the youth. In 1965 the Communist authorities demanded that the band stop performing under the name The Saints, because of the religious innuendo that the name carried. Forced to comply, the band took the name Phoenix. Nicu Covaci also changed the composition of the band, around 1963, by adding Claudiu Rotaru, Ioan \"Pilu\" Ştefanovici (born 1946) and Günther \"Spitzly\" Reininger (born 1950) to the lineup.  In 1965 they had their first big concert in Bucharest. Their performance brought a collaboration with Cornel Chiriac to record some of their songs. The first songs they recorded were \"Ştiu cǎ mǎ iubesti şi tu\" (\"I Know You Love Me Too\"), \"Dunăre, Dunăre\" (\"Danube, Danube\") and \"Bun e vinul ghiurghiuliu\" (\"Good is the Red Wine\"). The same year also marked the beginning of their collaboration with Victor Cârcu, who went on to write many of their most famous songs, such as \"Vremuri\" (\"Old Times\"), \"Şi totuşi ca voi sunt\" (\"And Yet I Am Like You\"), \"Nebunul cu ochii închişi\" (\"Crazy Man with closed eyes\"), \"Floarea stîncilor\" (\"Mountain Flower\") and \"Canarul\" (\"Canary\").  In December 1967 Phoenix had their first major series of concerts in many western cities, capped off by two huge concerts in Timişoara. After winning a few prizes in national students' contests, held at Iaşi the following year, in 1968 they recorded their first EP, Vremuri (Old Times), containing two original songs, Vremuri and Canarul (The Canary), and two covers (Lady Madonna - The Beatles and Friday on my Mind - Easybeats). A second EP would follow one year later, named Floarea stîncilor (The Flower of the Rocks), with all four songs being original compositions. Both albums sport a sound reminiscent of the beat style popular in that era.  They then started working on a rock theater play \"Omul 36/80\" (The Man 36/80) which won several prizes for originality.  In 1969 Ioan \"Pilu\" Ştefanovici was replaced by Dorel \"Baba\" Vintilă Zaharia (born 1943). For the next year the band became more and more popular, frequently visiting Bucharest and being invited in talk shows about music.  In 1970, Moni Bordeianu emigrated to the US, and, for a brief period of time the band suspended its activity, also due to total censorship that followed a protesting speech held by Bordeianu in his last concert. 1970 meant the blues period of the band. The formula used was Nicu Covaci - guitar, Günther \"Spitzly\" Reininger - piano and voice, Zoltan Covacs - bass guitar and Liviu Butoi - oboe and flute. Phoenix was born again the next year, with Covaci, Josef Kappl, Mircea Baniciu, Costin Petrescu (replaced in 1974 by Ovidiu Lipan, nicknamed \"Ţăndărică\") and Valeriu Sepi.  But the Communist officials were not very comfortable with the Western-style music that they were singing, and kept creating them problems. So Phoenix abandoned beat turned to Romanian folklore, pagan rituals, mystic animals and old traditions. In this same year, Phoenix started a collaboration with the Institute of Ethnography and Folklore and the Folklore section of Timişoara University on an ambitious project, a rock poem that combined traditional wooden instruments with modern sounds. During this project the band also started collaborating with Valeriu Sepi (born 1947), who eventually joined the band. The first outcome would be the 1972 LP Cei ce ne-au dat nume (Those Who Gave Us Our Names) - the first LP to be recorded in Romania by a Romanian band. Two years later, Mugur de fluier (Flute Bud) followed. Both albums underwent severe censorship.  In 1973 Phoenix represented Romania at the \"Golden harp\" festival in Bratislava (Slovakia) and then in the \"Disc festival\" in Sopot (Poland). Also, they wanted to record a new rock-opera, named \"Meşterul Manole\", but the communist officials censored it all, by \"losing\" the unique book with costume sketches and lyrics given to them for official approval. The result was only a EP with an extract from the opera, Meşterul Manole, uvertură (Meşterul Manole, uverture) and two older songs, Mamă, Mamă (Mother, Mother) and Te întreb pe tine, soare... (I'm asking you, sun...).  On Monday, 19 November 1973, Phoenix held a memorable concert in Bucharest, presenting their new hits \"Andri Popa\", \"Pavel Chinezu\" and \"Strunga\", which composed the new disc \"Mugur de fluier\". The new songs were still influenced by folklore yet had a new style. This style was the result of the collaboration with new songwriters Andrei Ujică and Şerban Foarţă. Based on those new songs Nicu Covaci created a new show \"Introducere la un concert despre muzica veche la români\" (\"Introduction to a concert about old Romanian music\") in which he introduced violins, flutes, archaic percussion and other traditional instruments. The show was never finished due to a new collaboration with \"Cenaclul Flacăra.\" This period is considered the peak for Phoenix. Their sound was considered original and powerful and full stadiums were common for their concerts.  Every winter the members of the band would retreat to Mount Semenic and plan their upcoming songs. That winter the show \"Zoosophia\", a title that would later change to \"Cantafabule\", was created. The show began by \"calling\" all mythic animals and continued by dedicating a song to each of them, finishing with the Phoenix, the band's symbol. The year 1975 brought a newcomer to the band, Ovidiu Lipan \"Ţăndărică\" (born 1953). The \"Cantafabule\" show was first presented in Timişoara in February 1975. The disc was recorded in a very short time and was published the same year with a misspelling in the title: \"Cantofabule.\" What followed were two years of almost continuous concerts but also the creation of the soundtrack for the movie \"Nemuritorii\".  By this time, the popularity of Phoenix had grown huge; people loved their songs not only for what they were, but also because they contained thinly-veiled allusions to the Communist regime. The band members, especially Nicu Covaci, found themselves increasingly harassed by the Securitate. Covaci married a Dutch woman and left the country in 1976. He returned in 1977, bringing in relief aid for those struck by the powerful earthquake on March 4. After two grandiose concerts in Constanţa and Tulcea, Covaci surprisingly left the country again, this time with all the band members (except Baniciu) hidden inside their Marshall speakers - a huge undertaking, since in Communist Romania it was extremely difficult to obtain approval to travel abroad, and illegal border crossing was punished with imprisonment.  After arriving in Germany, Phoenix disbanded. Kappl and a few others (Erlend Krauser, Ovidiu Lipan) formed a new band, Madhouse and released a not very successful album named From The East. In 1981, Covaci co-opted Neumann and Lipan and English bassist Tom Buggie, who had an amazing technical playing ability, under the name Transsylvania Phoenix (since a band named Phoenix already existed) and released an LP named Transsylvania, containing two old Phoenix songs translated into English to target the Western audience and five new ones. Covaci together with Kappl also released two EPs and one maxi single as Transsylvania-Phoenix.  In 1990 Phoenix made a triumphant comeback to Romania, with a highly emotional concert in their hometown Timişoara, the city that sparked the popular revolt in December 1989 that eventually led to the downfall of the Communist regime. In the following years, Phoenix toured a lot and released a few compilations of their older recordings. Internal frictions, especially between Covaci and Baniciu, were making headlines in the media.  A new album appeared in 2000, the first original album after their 1990 comeback; with the exception of Covaci, the lineup comprised none of the members from the '70s.  In 2002, the 40th Anniversary of the band brought together almost all former members in a supershow.  At the end of 2005 the band (in its classic gold lineup) released a new album, named Baba Novak.  As of 2010, the band still performs at live events.",

Plan B first emerged as a hip hop artist releasing his critically acclaimed debut album Who Needs Actions When You Got Words in 2006. His second studio album The Defamation of Strickland Banks (2010) was a soul record and went straight into the UK album chart at no. 1. He has also collaborated with other artists such as Chase & Status most notably on the top ten single \"End Credits\" (2009).\nDrew has also had a successful film career as an actor, with roles in Adulthood (2008), Harry Brown (2009) and 4.3.2.1 (2010). In 2012, Drew released the film Ill Manors, which he had written and directed, and Plan B also released an accompanying soundtrack album.\nDrew was born and brought up in Forest Gate, East London. His mother worked for a local authority and his father, Paul Ballance, played in a punk band, The Warm Jets, in the 1970s. Drew was five months old when his father walked out and six years old when he \"disappeared completely\". Growing up, he felt outcast from the rest of society:\nWe weren't working class but we weren't middle class, we were in the void in-between. I've always felt like a social outcast.\nFrom 11, Drew attended Anglo European School in Ingatestone, Essex, was later transferred to Tom Hood School, a specialist Science College in Leytonstone, before being expelled and sent to Tunmarsh Pupil Referral Unit in Newham, for children unable to attend mainstream school. He finally left school with three GCSEs. He taught himself how to play guitar at 14, first playing Blur and Oasis with friends, then going on to write his own R&B love songs. At 18, feeling uncomfortable with R&B, he turned towards rap and hip hop music and wrote \"Kidz\", inspired by the murder of Damilola Taylor\nThe whole reason for calling myself Plan B was that I was doing this sweet-boy Justin Timberlake shit, but I never felt comfortableâ€¦ When I started rapping, it was easier for me to feel comfortable.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Quinee Butler Reggaetonline.net - November 02, 2006 - Orlando Javier Valle, also known as Chencho from the well known duo Plan B, was born and raised in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. He has been a professional Reggaeton artist since 1999, but was involved in local talent shows since he can remember. Their first big hit was “Mi Chica MVP” from the album \"MVP\", and the duo has been among Reggaeton’s hit makers ever since. They had their solo album debut in 2002's Los Que La Montan, and have been featured in many productions. This year is no different - the duo has a new song, Tocarte, which is included on the album “Mas Flow: Los Benjamins”, as well as a Frikitona remix included on Boy Wonder’s upcoming production, Chosen Few: El Documental II.\n\nPlan B has been around long enough for Chencho to see that things have changed over the years. “Even though Plan B continues with its signature style of singing about sex with a little twist to it, Reggaeton was not the same as it is now. When it first started we did not have producers like we have now. We would get beats from Jamaica and write a song to it. Now we have great producers in Reggaeton that make the beats themselves. If you listen to Reggaeton from the early and mid nineties, you will definitely hear Reggae rhythms and understand some of the history of Reggaeton.” \n\nPlan B is a group that has definitely pushed against the grain when it comes to the sexual undertones of their songs, without crossing far over the line. While one cannot quite compare the groups’ songs with anything produced by a group like 2 Live Crew (American group known for its raunchy lyrics and explicit videos), except maybe a catchy beat; one can compare Chencho’s lyrics to those of George Michael’s ‘I Want Your Sex.’ Chencho explained to Reggaetonline.net that you can’t really compare Plan B’s style with any of the Hip-Hop artists out there. “I just like to focus on Reggaeton and sing Reggaeton, and that allows us to continue to be unique. Yes, sex is my main theme, but I don’t just sing about sex all the time.” Chencho said as he laughed. “What you have to realize is my focus is on making music for the clubs. People in the clubs want to “perrear” and I want to give them a club banger they can dance to (perrear is the upbeat signature dance for Reggaeton.) The children that listen to my music do not fully comprehend what I am singing about. They are innocent and simply like the songs for the beat and the catchy hook. However, teenagers pay more attention to the lyrical content and at the same time want a song they can perrear to. For the children that love to listen to my music, I often find myself searching the dictionary for words that mean the same, and at the same time won’t offend anyone.” \n\nIt will be a few more years for critics to be convinced that the genre of Reggaeton will continue to grow and prosper. As far as Reggaeton fans are concerned, the only reason for skepticism is the repetitive beat. “That is a big problem,” Chencho replied as he agreed with the comment, “that is what happened to Merengue. The genre of Merengue had a lot of good artists and peaked in the 90’s, but the music sounded the same. That’s the reason I said earlier I wouldn’t change, and will continue to sing with my style. I will never sing like Rakim & Ken-Y or any other Reggaeton artists. I refuse to sing the same as them because when we all sound a like, that's when we endanger the genre. I will continue to sing about sex because people like me like that.” With artists with the same attitude as Chencho, Reggaeton will never fall through the cracks. ",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Quavious Keyate Marshall (born April 2, 1991), known professionally as Quavo, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer. He is best known as a member of the hip hop trio Migos. Quavo is related to his fellow Migos members, being Takeoff's uncle and Offset's cousin.\n\nOutside of Migos, Quavo has been featured on four singles which have peaked within the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, including DJ Khaled's \"I'm the One\".\n\nEarly life\nQuavious Keyate Marshall was born on April 2, 1991, in Athens, Georgia. Marshall's mother, Edna Marshall, was a hairdresser and his father died when he was four years old. The three members of the Migos grew up together in Gwinnett County, a mostly suburban area half an hour northeast of Atlanta.\n\nMarshall attended Berkmar High School and was the starting quarterback of its football team during the 2009 season, his senior year. Although he was listed as 6 ft 1 in tall, he was thin for a football player (described by the Gwinnett Daily Post as \"spindly\"). Berkmar went 1-9 in the 2009 season, and Marshall went 19-of-25 for 201 yards and three touchdowns for the first win of the season. Quavo previously held the record by completing 28 passes in a game back in 2009.\n\nDespite finishing the football season for his senior year, Marshall dropped out of Berkmar months before graduation.\n\nMusical career\nMigos was formed in 2008 by Quavo and fellow rappers Takeoff and Offset. The three members are directly related and were raised together by Quavo's mother. Quavo is Takeoff's uncle, and Offset is Quavo's nephew. The group was originally known as Polo Club and are from Lawrenceville, Georgia. The group eventually decided to change their name to \"Migos\" after deciding Polo Club was too generic. The group released their first full-length project, a mixtape titled Juug Season, on August 25, 2011. They followed with the mixtape No Label, on June 1, 2012.\n\nMigos initially rose to prominence in 2013 after the release of their single \"Versace\". The song was remixed by Canadian rapper Drake and peaked at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 31 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. Quavo had his first lead single as a solo artist with the song \"Champions\" featuring several other artists, the song peaked at number 71 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAfter the success of Migos' second studio album Culture, which reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, Quavo was subsequently featured on several popular songs, including \"Congratulations\", \"I'm the One\", \"Portland\", and \"Strip That Down\". In an interview with GQ, Houston-based rapper Travis Scott, with whom Quavo previously worked with on the Young Thug collaboration \"Pick Up the Phone\", revealed he had a collaborative album with Quavo in the works.\n\nIn April 2017, Quavo was featured on The Fate of the Furious: The Album on the song \"Go Off\" with Lil Uzi Vert and Travis Scott. The song was eventually certified Gold by the RIAA. Quavo also released \"Ice Tray\" with Lil Yachty on December 14, 2017. The song peaked at number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nOn December 21, 2017, Quavo announced that he would release Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho with Travis Scott on December 22, 2017 without any prior promotion. The album had eight songs that debuted on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nOn January 26, 2018, Migos released Culture II. Quavo released three singles for his upcoming debut solo album, \"Workin Me\", \"Lamb Talk\" and \"Bubble Gum\" with \"Workin Me\" peaking at 52 on the Billboard Hot 100, Quavo's highest yet.\n\nLegal issues\nOn April 18, 2015, authorities stopped a Migos concert at Georgia Southern University and arrested all three members of the group, as well as several members of their entourage. Quavo was charged with possession of an unspecified Schedule II narcotic, possession of marijuana, possession of a firearm in a school safety zone, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. He was released from jail on bond, and later pleaded no contest to misdemeanor marijuana charges and received a 12-month sentence, which was suspended based on payment of fines.",

Throughout his career, he has sold more than 60 million albums worldwide. He is the founder of the Ricky Martin Foundation, a non-profit charity organization aimed at eliminating human trafficking.\nMartin got his start at age twelve with the all boy pop group Menudo; after five years with the group, he released his Spanish-language solo album, Ricky Martin, in 1991. He also acted on stage and on TV in Mexico, becoming a modest star in the country. In 1994 he starred on the American TV soap opera General Hospital, playing a Puerto Rican singer. In 1999, after several albums in Spanish, he released his first English-language album (also titled Ricky Martin), which included \"Livin' la Vida Loca\". The album sold 22 million copies and brought Martin international fame. His other studio albums include: Me Amarás (1993), A Medio Vivir (1995), Vuelve (1998), Sound Loaded (2000), Almas del Silencio (2003), Life (2005), and Música + Alma + Sexo (2011).\nOn the edge of the new millennium, Martin—almost by himself—gave Latino music an international face. An acclaimed performance at the 1999 Grammy Awards launched Martin into worldwide super-stardom. As Entertainment Weekly's Andrew Essex reported, \"his leather-pants, electro-pelvis version of 'La Copa de la Vida' single-handedly goosed a very dull  telecast, earning him a standing ovation.\" In 2010, Martin announced that he was a \"fortunate homosexual man\", ending years of fan speculation on the topic. His twin sons, Matteo and Valentino, were born via a surrogate mother in 2008. Martin also co-owns a Miami restaurant, Casa Salsa, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2007. On November 4, 2011, Ricky Martin was granted Spanish citizenship for his artistic merits and for his grandmother being Spanish-born. Martin currently stars as Che in the Broadway revival of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Evita.",

They continued to chart in other territories such as Europe and South America, where they earned various Gold and Platinum awards until the beginning of the new millennium. In 2002 the duo took a break from recording and touring when Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour.

In 2011 they released Charm School, their first studio album in ten years. This was followed by Travelling a year later.\nTheir songs \"It Must Have Been Love\" and \"Listen to Your Heart\" continue to receive wide radio airplay, with both singles recently receiving awards from BMI for achieving four million radio plays.They have sold an estimated 60 million records worldwide,with over 10 million in certified units from Germany, the US and the UK, achieving gold and platinum certifications for Joyride and Look Sharp! in all three regions.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Sabaton was formed in 1999. After the first songs were recorded in Peter Tägtgren's studio, The Abyss, Sabaton was contacted by a couple of record labels. The band decided to sign up for Italian label Underground Symphony, under which internationally released the promo CD Fist for Fight —actually a compilation consisting of material from two demotapes recorded between 1999 and 2000— with the intention to promote forthcoming releases.\n\nIn 2002, a new album was recorded. Metalizer was supposed to be distributed by Underground Symphony as the band's debut album, but after two years of waiting, during which the band held various performances across Sweden, the album was abandoned.\nJoakim Brodén playing at Global East Rock Festival 2010\nPrimo Victoria\n\nThe band returned a second album titled Primo Victoria and found themselves in negotiations with several international record labels. They eventually signed with Black Lodge, the metal division of Sound Pollution. In early 2005, they recruited Daniel Myhr to relieve Joakim Brodén, who played keyboards in addition to singing, of his keyboard duties.\nAttero Dominatus\n\nTheir third album Attero Dominatus continued the war theme of Primo Victoria with songs like \"Back in Control\" (which focuses on the British retaking of the Falkland Islands during the Falklands War), \"Attero Dominatus\" (about the Battle of Berlin which brought about the end of World War II in Europe) and \"Angels Calling\" (about trench warfare during World War I), and was released in Europe on 28 July 2006.\nMetalizer\n\nIn March 2007, Sabaton released Metalizer as a double disc together with Fist for Fight, along with the previously unreleased song \"Birds of War\".\nThe Art of War\n\nAs a follow up to Metalizer, in May 2008, Sabaton released its fourth album The Art of War an album inspired by the influential book by Sun Tzu. The decision to base the album upon Sun Tzu's book came from the idea that in the 2000 years since the book was written, the human race has achieved many things but apart from weapon advancements, war and tactics have remained basically the same. The album contains the singles \"Cliffs of Gallipoli\" and \"Ghost Division\". The album has received extremely positive reviews so far.\nSabaton performing at Norway Rock Festival in 2010\n\nIn September 2008 it was announced that Sabaton would be performing at the 2009 ProgPowerUSA X festival in Atlanta GA USA. In addition, Sabaton were the first band confirmed for the festival Bloodstock '09 in Derby, UK. Furthermore, they toured Europe in 2009 as an opening act on the Hammerfall Tour. After their Bloodstock performance, the band went on a tour with DragonForce, towards the end of 2009, for 18 shows in the UK.\nCoat of Arms\n\nThe band had hoped to begin recording the next album in October but with concerts booked and the DragonForce support tour the following month, it was pushed back. On Wednesday December 23, 2009, the band announced the name of their forthcoming album. Coat of Arms contains a majority of songs about World War II, but also has songs about other wars, like the Winter War \"White Death\". They announced it on their official website, and posted a link to a YouTube video containing the album art and a teaser music sample. Coat of Arms was released on May 21, 2010. The first music video, for Uprising, was released on August 1, 2010 and features Peter Stormare. This was accompanied by a European tour. A second music video, for Screaming Eagles, was released on May 25.\nRe-Armed editions\n\nCame out on September 24, 2010, included new bonus tracks never heard before\n\n    Primo Victoria\n    Attero Dominatus\n    Metalizer\n    The Art of War\n\nLineup Change, Carolus Rex, and The Swedish Empire Tour\n\nOn March 31, 2012 vocalist Joakim Broden confirmed rumors that the band would be going separate ways. Guitarists Oskar Montelius and Rikard Sundén, drummer Daniel Mulback and keyboardist Daniel Mÿhr would be departing Sabaton for unspecified reasons. Sabaton would be joined by touring members Chris Rörland and Thobbe Englund on guitar, and Robban Bäck on drums. Until a new keyboardist is found Sabaton will use digital recordings of their keyboard while touring.\n\nFollowing the announcement of a new lineup taking the stage the first single for the album \"Carolus Rex\" titled \"Carolus Rex\" was released on April 4, 2012. The single was immediately released in both Swedish and English lyrical formats for download off of Swedish iTunes, and was available for world wide download on April 8, 2012. Coinciding the release of the new single, Sabaton also announced their world wide tour in support of \"Carolus Rex\" headlined as \"The Swedish Empire Tour\". This will also be the first time Sabaton has performed live with the new lineup.\n\n\"Carolus Rex\" was released on May 22, 2012 in the United States and Sweden, and May 25, 2012 in the rest of Europe. The album is available in both Swedish and English versions. Sabaton will also release a deluxe edition of \"Carolus Rex\" containing 2 discs of both lyrical versions of the album.\n\nRegarding the line-up change, Sabaton's bassist Pär Sundström commented:\"It appears to be sudden, but it was actually started years ago when some members already got tired of constant touring. And with wives and kids back home it does not get any easier. During the recordings of Carolus Rex I drew a map of what the band will be doing the coming 3 years and for some that was too much commitment...\"\n\nThe former members of Sabaton have formed a band called \"Civil War\", including vocalist Patrik Johansson and bassist Stefan Eriksson.\n\nIn November 2012, drummer Robban Bäck decided to take a break from touring due to becoming a father. Snowy Shaw will replace him as touring drummer.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Kisean Anderson (born February 3, 1990), better known by his stage name Sean Kingston, is a Jamaican American rapper, singer and songwriter. He pursued a music career and debuted in 2007 with the album Sean Kingston. Kingston was born on February 3, 1990, in Miami, Florida and moved to Kingston, Jamaica when he was six. He attended high school in Ocho Rios. His grandfather was the noted Jamaican reggae producer Lawrence Lindo, who worked under the stage name Jack Ruby. At age 11, Kingston spent 3 weeks in jail for burglary, and Kingston lived in a car while his mother was incarcerated for identity theft. Sean Kingston was discovered through MySpace by Tommy Rotem at Beluga Heights, and signed to the label in a partnership deal with Sony. Beluga is a label notable for its focus on discovering and developing artists. In an interview with HitQuarters label head and producer J.R. Rotem described this process with regards to Kingston: In a venture between Epic Records and Koch Records, Kingston recorded and released the single \"Beautiful Girls\" in May 2007. The single, based on the bass line and lyrical \"association\" of the 1961 hit \"Stand by Me\" by Ben E. King, reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks and topped the UK Singles Chart along with many other international charts. Similarly, the song \"Me Love\" samples the main hook out Led Zeppelin's \"D'yer Mak'er\", from their 1973 album Houses of the Holy. The song also debuted at number one in Australia, where it knocked off Fergie's \"Big Girls Don't Cry\", which had been at number one for nine weeks. The song stayed on the Canadian Hot 100 number one spot for over six weeks before getting knocked down to third place by the Plain White T's. \"Beautiful Girls\" remained at number one in Canada longer than any other song in 2007. In 2007, Kingston was the opening act for Gwen Stefani's The Sweet Escape Tour and for select dates on Beyoncé's The Beyoncé Experience Tour. In 2008, he was one of the opening acts for the Australian leg of Kelly Clarkson's My December Tour. Since Sean is a Jamaican singer, he got his stage name \"Kingston\" from the capital of Jamaica called Kingston, Jamaica.",

Gomez & the Scene released their second studio album, A Year Without Rain, later that year. The album entered the Top 5 of the Billboard 200, and spawned two Top 40 hits.

Following the release of the album, Gomez confirmed she would be taking a musical hiatus to focus on her acting career. She then went on to appear in the films Hotel Transylvania (2012) and Spring Breakers (2013), the latter of which saw Gomez portraying a more adult role.\n\nDespite her early comments of a musical hiatus, Gomez confirmed in October 2012 that she was working on her solo debut album. The lead single, \"Come & Get It\", was released in April 2013. It became her first Top 10 hit on the Hot 100 chart, and was certified Gold by the RIAA. The album's second single, \"Slow Down\", was released in June. Gomez has since announced plans of a second musical hiatus following the release of Stars Dance in July. Outside of her work in the entertainment industry, Gomez is involved in philanthropic activities through charity work and various social and environmental causes.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Gionata Boschetti (Italian pronunciation: ; born 7 December 1992 in Sesto San Giovanni, Lombardy), better known by the pseudonym Sfera Ebbasta (pronounced ), is an Italian rapper.\nSfera Ebbasta rose to prominence after the release of the XDVR album, recorded with the collaboration of the record producer Charlie Charles, which achieved commercial success in Italy. This success was replicated with releases Sfera Ebbasta (2016), Rockstar (2018), and its re-issue Popstar Edition (2018).\nFirst years (2011–2013)\nSfera was born in the Milanese town of Sesto San Giovanni, but grew up in the neighbourly Cinisello Balsamo, where the rapper began his musical activity by uploading videos on YouTube between 2010 and 2012 without any success. In this period he started getting into contact with producer Charlie Charles, during a Hip Hop TV party. Thus, they formed the collective Billion Headz Money Gang, better known by the acronym BHMG. On 15 September 2013, he published Emergenza Mixtape Vol. 1.\nXDVR (2014-2016)\nSince November 2014, he has produced several pieces in collaboration with Charlie Charles and published them on YouTube with their videos. After the release of the song Panette he began to be contacted by some record labels.\nOn 11 June 2015 he made his debut with the first studio album XDVR (standing for \"per davvero\", in English \"for real\"), made up by some of the singles published in the previous months, as well as other unpublished ones. Initially released as a free download, the album was reissued in a reloaded version on November 23 through Roccia Music, an independent record label of Marracash and Shablo, and distributed in the national sales circuits; in addition to the songs already present in the original, the tracklist included the unreleased XDVRMX (with Marracash and Luchè), Ciny (referring to his hometown Cinisello, of which video clip was also shot) and Trap Kings. The album received a good success in the underground musical scene and greatly increased the popularity of trap music in Italy, also receiving excellent feedback from the specialized critics; however it was also the subject of numerous criticisms as various songs spoke of life in suburban neighborhoods (mainly inspired by the street reality of his city, Cinisello Balsamo), including criminal activities and consumption of drugs such as codeine and marijuana.\nOn 20 January 2016 the video of the unreleased track Blunt & Sprite was published on YouTube, while during the same year Sfera Ebbasta featured in a track of the album Anarchie by the French rapper SCH, positively impressed by listening to the rapper's pieces during a stay in Italy: he also made the track Cartine Cartier, produced by Charlie Charles and DJ Kore, extracted as a promotional single of the album.\nSfera Ebbasta (2016–2017)\nOn 9 September 2016 the rapper published his first solo studio album, the homonymous Sfera Ebbasta, distributed by the record Universal (in collaboration with Def Jam) and anticipated by the singles BRNBQ (which received a golden record certificate for over 25,000 copies sold), Cartine Cartier and Figli di papà, the latter a platinum-certified record for having sold over 50,000 copies. In this album the rapper detached himself from the more gangsta themes of XDVR to open himself to wider topics. Supported by a promotion also at a television level, participating in broadcasts such as Matrix Chiambretti on Canale 5 and the radio program Albertino Everyday, conducted by Albertino on Radio Deejay, the album received great success in Italy, debuting at the top of the album charts, as well as entering the charts of various European countries; the album was also certified as a gold record by FIMI for having sold over 25,000 copies. Between October 2016 and March 2017, the rapper promoted the album through the Sfera Ebbasta Tour, performing in various cities of Italy.\nRockstar (2017–present)\nOn 10 March 2017, Sfera Ebbasta released the single Dexter, produced by Charlie Charles and Sick Luke, as well as taking part in Charlie Charles's single Bimbi along with rappers Izi, Rkomi, Tedua and Ghali. Subsequently, the rapper performed at the TIM MTV Awards 2017 and at the Wind Music Awards 2017, during which he presented a further unreleased song, Tran Tran, published on June 9 for digital download.\n\nOn September 22 of the same year Gué Pequeno released the single Lamborghini in his album entitled Gentleman, which featured the vocal participation of Sfera Ebbasta; this single achieved good success in Italy, reaching the peak of Top Singoli, the official ranking for the most listened and sold singles in Italy.\nOn 3 January 2018 the rapper announced his third studio album Rockstar, produced again by Charlie Charles and released on the 19th of the same month. The album was commercialized in Italian and international editions, the latter characterized by collaborations with various artists such as Tinie Tempah, Rich the Kid and Quavo; the album debuted at the top of the FIMI Album Ranking. At the same time, all 11 tracks have conquered the top twelve positions of Top Single (with the sole exception of Ed Sheeran's Perfect single, in sixth place). Also, thanks to the success of his album, the rapper became the first Italian artist to position himself among the first hundred of the world ranking compiled by Spotify.\n\nOn 13 March 2018 the rapper, along with Charlie Charles, announced the establishment of the record label Billion Headz Music Group, while on 4 May the unpublished single Peace & Love was released, which also involved the rapper Ghali.\nOn 7 December 2018 the re-edition of Rockstar, subtitled Popstar Edition, is published, including a second disc containing some remixes and the unreleased tracks Popstar, Uh Ah Hey and Happy Birthday (the latter extracted as a single).\nOn the night of 7 to 8 December 2018, Sfera Ebbasta was due to perform in a nightclub in Corinaldo, near Ancona; during the wait for his appearance, at around 1am, a panic induced stampede caused six deaths and dozens of injuries.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Orville Richard Burrell (born October 22, 1968), better known by his stage name Shaggy, is a Jamaican-American Grammy Award-winning reggae singer and rapper. He is perhaps best known for his 1995 single \"Boombastic\" and 2000 single \"It Wasn't Me\". He has been noted as having a baritone-range singing voice, and he is easily identifiable by his signature slurred rapping and vocal style. He is said to have taken his nickname from his shaggy hair.\n\nBorn in Kingston, Jamaica, at the age of 18 his family moved to the Flatbush area of Brooklyn, New York, from Jamaica. In 1987, he took singing courses in Brooklyn and was discovered a year later, while singing in the streets with friends. In 1988, he joined the United States Marine Corps as a Field Artillery Cannon Crewman with \"S\" Battery, 5th Battalion 10th Marines. While enlisted in the Marines he served during Operation Desert Storm during the Persian Gulf War. It was during this time that Shaggy perfected his signature singing voice, breaking the constant monotony of running and marching cadences with his flair for inflection. It is also where he got the inspiration for his song \"Boombastic\".\n\nHe then had a major comeback in 2000, with big hit album Hot Shot, which was certified 6x Platinum in the U.S. The album featured worldwide number-one hit singles \"It Wasn't Me\" and \"Angel\", the latter of which was built around two song samples - Merrilee Rush's 1968 hit \"Angel of the Morning\" (which was remade in 1981 by Juice Newton), and The Steve Miller Band's 1973 hit \"The Joker\". The album hit number one on the Billboard 200 and UK albums chart.However, his 2002 release Lucky Day, and the 2005 album Clothes Drop, failed to match Hot Shot's success, although Lucky Day still went gold. The albums, however, found success in Europe, especially with heavy airplay for the single \"Hey Sexy Lady\". Shaggy remade the Scooby-Doo theme song on the soundtrack titled \"Shaggy, Where Are You?\". Shaggy also recorded the theme for the 2002 movie Showtime. Shaggy's last top 40 single in the US was \"Angel\" from the album Hot Shot.\n\n",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Sia Kate Isobelle Furler (born 18 December 1975), better known as Sia (pron.: /sɪə/or pron.: /ˈsiːə/), is an Australian downtempo, pop, and jazz singer and songwriter. In 2000, her single \"Taken for Granted\" was a top 10 hit in the United Kingdom. Her 2008 album Some People Have Real Problems peaked in the top 30 on the Billboard 200. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2009, she won the award for 'Best Music DVD' and received six nominations at the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 and won 'Best Independent Release' and 'Best Pop Release' for We Are Born and 'Best Video' for the song \"Clap Your Hands\". Furler has also collaborated and performed with Zero 7, Christina Aguilera and more recently Hilltop Hoods, David Guetta, Flo Rida, Afrojack, Shakira and Rihanna. She collaborated on Billboard Hot 100 top ten hits, \"Titanium\" with DJ David Guetta, and \"Wild Ones\" with rapper Flo Rida. Both achieved international success\nFurler was born in Adelaide, South Australia on 18 December 1975. She went to North Adelaide Primary School. Her father, Phil B. Colson, was a musician in various bands including Foreday Riders, Rum Jungle, Fat Time, Jump Back Jack, and Mount Lofty Rangers. Her mother, Loene Furler, is a singer, songwriter, musician, and art lecturer who also provided backing vocals for Mount Lofty Rangers. Her parents were both in an Adelaide rockabilly band, The Soda Jerx. Furler is the niece of U.K. based actor/singer Kevin Colson. Singer/songwriter Colin Hay of Men at Work though not related, is affectionately known as \"Uncle Colin\". \"Philby\" Colson played slide guitar on Men at Work's last single, \"Everything I Need\" from their album Two Hearts, then toured extensively with \"The Colin Hay Band\" in 1988. In her 2008 NPR Music interview, she said that she had mimicked other singers while growing up and counts Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder and Sting as her early influences. She attended Adelaide High School. At fourteen, Furler said, her parents had enough money to pay for her getting her now famous snaggletooth removed, or a chance to attend school in Italy. Furler chose Italy, and she said that she doesn't regret keeping her snaggletooth.\nDiscovering her voice in a karaoke bar while in Italy, taking a university gap year, Sia explains to Gigwise: “I got up and sang at this karaoke bar in Italy. I didn’t like any of the songs they had so I just got them to clap their hands and sang ‘Lean On Me’ by Bill Withers.” Because of her unique singing voice, Furler was offered the chance to record a song by a local DJ who happened to be in the bar. Fourteen years on and it all seems rather distant and amusing, as Sia recounts holding back the laughter: “I was seventeen and writing about racism and homophobia; I had a message and wanted to change the world. Then I went back to university in Adelaide (the University of Adelaide) to finish studying Italian and Politics and I hated it after having spent a year out of school, so I quit straight away.”",

Al mismo tiempo, el argentino Noel Schajris debutó en 1992 como solista y luego ocho años más tarde con su álbum debut Cita en las nubes en 1999. Siendo ambos músicos, compositores y cantantes, en el año 1999 descubrieron la fórmula ideal para unir sus talentos y personalidades. Noel: \"Cuando tuvimos nuestra primera reunión para formar Sin Bandera, hubo química inmediata. Hablamos sobre nuestra música favorita, de los últimos discos que habíamos comprado, de los cantautores que más nos llegaban y coincidimos en todo\". Leonel: \"Además, a los dos nos gusta cantar, pero Noel prefiere el piano y yo la guitarra, por lo que en ningún momento hubo choque de intereses, sino una integración de gustos musicales. De hecho en la primera reunión que hicimos para empezar a planear el disco, hicimos tres canciones ¡en un día!, incluso algunas de ellas son parte del disco\".",

Originally from and born to Nigerian parents he moved from Lagos to London aged three. His family history can be traced back further to Ethiopia, to the Falash Mura community. He is a producer and DJ commonly associated with the North London Grime scene, including Roll Deep and Boy Better Know. \nThe name “Skepta” originated from the word Sceptre, a type of staff. He did not like the way it was spelt and felt that he wanted a unique stage name so ‘that he could type “Skepta” in YouTube and only he would come up.’ So, he changed it. \n\nSkepta started his music career after he won a MC battle with over 300 people contesting beating Tempa T in the final. He also formed a partnership with his brother JME and became renowned throughout Greater London for his hit single (he also produced), “Private Caller” which featured many of his Meridian Crew from Meridian Walk in Tottenham.\n\nSkepta (Managing Director) along with brother JME (CEO), began their grime label Boy Better Know in late 2005. The phrase “Boy Better Know” was originated by Big H the artist.\nThis phrase was then taken by Skepta and JME. Early 2006 saw the release of ‘Shut Yuh Mut’ - Boy Better Know Edition 1 which features all 3 artists and throughout the years has contributed and aided many other artists such as Frisco and Wiley to put out mixtapes, along with JME (4 mixtapes) and Skepta’s September 2007 release ‘Greatest Hits’, which was distributed nationwide.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Skillet is an American Christian rock band formed in Memphis, Tennessee in 1996. The band currently consists of husband and wife John (lead vocals, bass) and Korey Cooper (rhythm guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), along with Jen Ledger (drums, vocals) and Seth Morrison (lead guitar). The band has released eight albums, two receiving Grammy nominations: Collide and Comatose. Over the past 15 years, Skillet has undergone several lineup changes, leaving founder John Cooper as the only original member remaining in the band.\n\nSkillet formed in 1996 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee progressive rock band Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor encouraged them to form their own band as a side-project. Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut Skillet. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic that comes up often among fans and the band itself, is the name 'Skillet'. John Cooper, the lead vocalist, explains that it was a joke at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet to come up with something unique. Hence the band name 'Skillet'. The band name is still somewhat of a joke between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title.\n\nSkillet recorded their follow-up album throughout 1997, titled Hey You, I Love Your Soul, which was released in April 1998. Their second effort was a change in style from the band's first release. With this release, Skillet would abandon their post-grunge approach for a lighter alternative rock and a style. His wife Korey was enlisted soon after to play keyboards live in order to alleviate John's live performance duties.",

Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue.\nAfter releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Ryan O'Neal's journey has taken many turns over the past twelve years under the moniker of Sleeping At Last. The band began with Ryan on guitar, Chad O'Neal on drums, and friend Dan Perdue on bass as a teenage garage band in Wheaton, Illinois (Chicagoland-area).  It has organically transitioned to original songwriter O'Neal as a solo artist continuing the gorgeous thread of work that has amazed and captivated listeners over all these years.   Near its inception, Sleeping At Last's amateur debut album, \"Capture,\" was noticed by Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan, who helped expose the music to the major-label world. Soon after, the band signed to Interscope Records and released \"Ghosts\" (2003), their first official full-length album. Two independently-released full-length records followed: \"Keep No Score\" (2006) and \"Storyboards\" (2009). In between the writing and recording of albums, the band has established a reputation for a pitch-perfect live show, successfully headlining several U.S. tours and sharing the stage with such artists as Switchfoot, Yellowcard, Something Corporate, Billy Corgan's Zwan, Alanis Morrisette, Lifehouse, and Phantom Planet, just to name a few. The creative process has always been protected, as the band self-produced each record, working with respected mixers such as John Goodmanson and Alan Moulder. On \"Storyboards,\" the song \"Clockwork\" featured an orchestral arrangement composed by the legendary Van Dyke Parks, which was a veritable dream come true for O'Neal. All along, their grassroots following has continued to build strength and demonstrates fierce loyalty to the music that has progressed alongside their own lives for all these years.    Sleeping At Last has long been a beacon shining brightly on behalf of independent artists. In the ever-changing climate of the music industry, the quest for a successful independent career seems evermore difficult to attain. From his new home in L.A., O'Neal pursues this challenge relentlessly through his commitment to musical integrity in his songwriting, and in this way nurtures a unique and personal relationship with his listeners. He has remained true to the things that brought him to music in the first place: his love of melody and the power of words. His music and lyrics emerge from a place that is honest, raw, and spiritual: Says Ryan, \"Our faith is a big part of who we are, but we have always intended our music to be for anyone that cares to listen, no matter who they are or what they believe in. Everyone hears a song in a different light.\"  In keeping with this, Ryan's lyrics ask every important question that occurs.  While he promises no fast, sure answers, he somehow always offers hope as the consistent, overarching theme.",

The group comprised five members, who each later adopted nicknames initially ascribed to them: Melanie Chisholm (\"Sporty Spice\"), Emma Bunton (\"Baby Spice\"), Melanie Brown (\"Scary Spice\"), Victoria Beckham (\"Posh Spice\"), and Geri Halliwell (\"Ginger Spice\"). They were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single, \"Wannabe\" in 1996, which hit number-one in more than 30 countries and helped establish the group as a global phenomenon. Credited for being the pioneers that paved the way for the commercial breakthrough of teen pop in the late 1990s, their debut album, Spice, sold more than 28 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in music history. They have sold over 75 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling female group of all time. Measures of their success include international record sales, a 2007-2008 reunion tour, merchandising, record-breaking achievements, iconic symbolism such as Geri Halliwell's Union Jack dress, representing \"Girl Power\", a box-office film, Spice World, and their internationally recognised nicknames. The group became one of the most successful marketing engines ever, with their global grosses estimated at $500-800 million between 1996 and 1998, and the group earned up to $75 million per year.\n\nUnder the guidance of their mentor and manager Simon Fuller, the group embraced merchandising and became a regular feature of the British and global press. In 1996, Top of the Pops magazine gave each member of the group aliases, which were adopted by the group and media. According to Rolling Stone journalist and biographer David Sinclair, \"Scary, Baby, Ginger, Posh and Sporty were the most widely recognised group of individuals since John, Paul, George, and Ringo\". They were the biggest popular cultural icons of the 1990s, according to a survey carried out by Trivial Pursuit, winning by 80 percent in a poll of 1,000 people, stating that \"Girl Power\" defined the decade. They are cited as part of the 'second wave' '90s British Invasion of the US.\n\nOn 31 May 1998, Halliwell unexpectedly left the group in the middle of numerous rumours. The four remaining members released their third album Forever, in November 2000. On 28 June 2007, all five reformed before the launch of their reunion tour in December, alongside the release of their Greatest Hits album. In December, a new documentary titled Giving You Everything aired on television. The tour is estimated to have grossed US$100 million, despite a shortened run. The tour won the Billboard 2008 Touring Award for Top Boxscore for a 17-night stand at London's O2 Arena.",

He won Best Grime Act at the 2014 MOBO Awards and was named as an artist to look out for in the BBC's influential Sound of 2015 list.\n\nStormzy originates from Thornton Heath, London, and attended Harris Academy South Norwood. He began MCing at the age of 11 and would clash with older MCs at his local youth club.\n\nAfter garnering attention on the UK underground music scene via his Wicked Skengman series of freestyles over classic grime beats, Stormzy released his debut EP Dreamers Disease independently in July 2014. On 22 October, Stormzy won Best Grime Act at the MOBO awards. Later that month he became the first unsigned rapper to appear on Later with Jools Holland performing the song \"Not That Deep\" from Dreamers Disease.\n\nIn November 2014, Stormzy collaborated with rapper Chip and Shalo on the track \"I'm Fine\", also appearing in a video for the song. The track is part of Chip's upcoming Believe & Achieve project.\n\nOn 7 January 2015, Stormzy came number 3 in the BBC Introducing top 5 on Radio 1. In March 2015 he released the single \"Know Me From\", which entered the UK Singles Chart at number 49. In September 2015, he released a final instalment to his \"WickedSkengMan\" freestyle series, \"WickedSkengMan 4\", onto iTunes, along with a studio version of his \"Shut Up\" freestyle over XTC's Functions On The Low instrumental. The track debuted at number 18 on the UK chart dated 24 September, becoming Stormzy's first top 40 hit and the first ever freestyle to reach the top 40 in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn 12 December 2015, Stormzy performed \"Shut Up\" during British heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua's ring-walk for his fight versus Dillian Whyte. Originally, \"Shut Up\", released as part of the \"WickedSkengMan 4\" single EP in September 2015, charted at number 59. Since the performance, it began climbing up the iTunes chart and into the top 40. As a result, Stormzy launched a Christmas number 1 campaign to get the song to number 1.

Of mixed Belgo-Rwandan descent, he distinguished himself in both the hip-hop and the electronic music. He first became famous with the song Alors On Danse which remained at number one for several weeks in numerous countries throughout Europe.\n\nHe was born to a Rwandan father and a Belgian mother. At the age of eleven Paul van Haver already showed an interest in music and attended ‘l’Académie Musicale de Jette’, where he studied music history and learnt to play the drums.\n\nIn 2000 he appeared as a rapper called Opmaestro, though he later changed his stage name to Stromae (“Maestro” with the syllables switched, a practice called verlan). It was with this name that van Haver became successful.\n\nAt the age of 18, he founded a rap group called Suspicion, along with rapper J.E.D.I. in Eichof. They produced the song and music video “Faut k’t’arrêtes le Rap”, though later, J.E.D.I. decided to leave the rap duo.\n\nIn order to finance his private school education, van Haver worked part-time in the hospitality industry, but his school performance wasn’t up to standard. It was only later, when he registered at l’Institut National de Radioélectricité et Cinématographie, that he released his first album “Juste un cerveau, un flow, un fond et un mic…”.\n\nIn 2008 he signed a 4-year record deal with “Because Music” and “Kilomaître”. In 2009 Paul worked a young trainee at the musical radio station NRJ in Brussels. Vincent Verbelen, Music Manager, was impressed by the talent of Stromae’s first single Alors On Danse and decided to air it for the first time on NRJ. The response from listeners was one of extreme enthusiasm and Stromae’s career was launched. Sales quickly rose to number one in Belgium in just a matter of weeks.\n\nVertigo Records, a label of Mercury Records France (Universal Music Group) signed him for a worldwide licensing deal soon after this. By May 2010 the track had reached number one in France, the Netherlands, Greece, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Toto is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1976. The band's current lineup consists of Joseph Williams (lead vocals), David Paich (keyboards), Steve Porcaro (keyboards), Steve Lukather (guitars, vocals), and Simon Phillips (drums). Bass player Nathan East is currently touring with Toto as a guest musician, as Mike Porcaro is too ill to tour. Toto is known for a musical style that combines elements of pop, rock, soul, funk, progressive rock, hard rock, R&B and jazz. They are regularly associated with the soft rock genre.\nDavid Paich and Jeff Porcaro had played together as session musicians on several albums and decided to form a band. David Hungate, Steve Lukather, Steve Porcaro and Bobby Kimball were recruited before their first album release. The band enjoyed great commercial success in the late 1970s and 1980s, beginning with the band's self-titled debut released in 1978. With the release of the critically acclaimed and commercially successful Toto IV (1982), Toto became one of the best-selling music groups of their era. They are best known for the Top 5 hits \"Hold the Line\", \"Rosanna\", \"Africa\" and \"Georgy Porgy\". Although their popularity in the United States diminished in the 1990s and 2000s, they remained popular internationally, playing only a small number of shows in the USA. Several changes to the lineup have been made over the years. In 2008, Lukather announced his departure from the band, and the remaining band members later went their separate ways. In the summer of 2010, Toto reformed and went on a short European tour, with a new lineup, to benefit Mike Porcaro, who had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and is no longer an active member of the band.\nThe band has released a total of 17 albums, and have sold over 35 million albums to date. The group was honored with several Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame in 2009.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Jacob Taio Cruz (born 23 April 1985), known professionally as Taio Cruz, (Portuguese: ) is a British singer-songwriter, record producer, occasional rapper, and entrepreneur. In 2008, he released his debut album Departure, which he wrote, arranged and produced himself. It achieved initial success in the United Kingdom and earned him a MOBO Award nomination.\nIn June 2010, Cruz released his follow-up album Rokstarr, which includes the number one singles \"Break Your Heart\" and \"Dynamite\". Cruz has collaborated with Kesha and Fabolous on the single \"Dirty Picture\", as well as Kylie Minogue and Travie McCoy on his single \"Higher\". Additionally, Cruz penned and recorded the song \"Telling the World\" as the lead single from the soundtrack to the 2011 animated film Rio. Cruz's third studio album, TY.O, was first released in Germany in December 2011. In 2012 Cruz co-wrote the song \"Without You\", giving David Guetta his first U.S. number 1 and adding to Cruz's hit streak with his 3rd number 1 song in the U.S. Cruz was born in London, England, to a Nigerian father and a Brazilian mother. He attended Bilton Grange, a private prep school in Rugby, Warwickshire.\nCruz began writing songs when he was 12. His songwriting career began at age 19 as part of Tricky Stewart's writing collective, RedZone Entertainment. Cruz achieved notability in 2005 when he was awarded a Brit Award for co-writing Will Young's 2004 single, \"Your Game\".\nCruz is the founder and chief executive of Rokstarr Music London, which in 2006 released his debut single \"I Just Wanna Know\". The single attracted significant attention from radio, and also from music industry insiders, who were already well aware of the artist's potential; manager Jamie Binns, who began representing Cruz at this time, later told HitQuarters: \"He was a guy that everyone had earmarked to do damage in the future.\" Although the single received a reasonable amount of radio airplay, it did not perform as well as expected in either territory. However, rather than lose faith in Cruz, the labels were eager to negotiate an album deal, as by this time they had listened to his other songs and were ever more convinced by his capability.\nCruz's admirers included Island Records's Darcus Beese and Monte Lipman, who, according to Binns, \"both believed 'I Just Wanna Know' fitted the format on both sides of the Atlantic.\" In 2006, Cruz signed a split single deal with Universal Music Group companies, Republic Records and the UK branch of Island Records.",

They like to see themselves as \"a steady flowing psychedelic groove rock band that emphasizes dream-like melody.\"\nThe origins of the band can be found in the Perth music scene. Parker played in a number of bands, one being the Dee Dee Dums, a rock duo that consisted of Parker (guitar) and Luke Epstein (drums). Tame Impala emerged as a Kevin Parker home-recording project in this period and he posted a number of tracks on Myspace. This brought interest from a number of labels and eventually, he signed a worldwide deal with the independent Modular Recordings. To transfer these recordings to a live-stage, Parker enlisted the help of Dominic Simper (bass) and Jay Watson (drums) and began playing at some local gigs.",

The core band consists of singer Wesley Schultz on guitar, Jeremiah Fraites on drums, and Neyla Pekarek on cello and vocals.\nIn the spring of 2005, Wesley Schultz and Jeremiah Fraites began to collaborate, writing together and playing gigs around New York. Originally based in Ramsey, New Jersey, they later relocated to New York City. After battling the city's cutthroat music scene and high cost of living, the two decided to expand their horizons. They packed everything they owned—nothing more than a couple suitcases of clothes and a trailer full of musical instruments—and headed for Denver, Colorado. It was there they met Neyla Pekarek after posting a Craigslist ad for a cellist. They started to perform shows in small venues like the 100 capacity Meadowlark around Denver, writing songs, and eventually recording several songs in Jer's attic. In the Spring of 2011, they signed a management deal with Onto Entertainment managers Christen Greene and David Meinert, after the two saw a video on YouTube of the band playing their future hit single \"Ho Hey\" in a small apartment. Onto fronted the band money to record a full length album in Seattle at Bear Creek Studio with producer Ryan Hadlock (mixed in LA by Kevin Augunas at Fairfax Studio).",

        "strBiographyEN" : "In early 2012 a mysterious band appeared online. The group, The Neighbourhood, revealed no biographical information, no photos and no backstory, offering only a moody track titled “Female Robbery.” Fans and the press were confounded, scouring the Internet for any information that might lead them to the identity of these musicians. Pieces of the puzzle, some reflecting reality and some not so much, began to emerge. The Neighbourhood were a quintet. They were from California despite the British spelling of their name. They had a second track, “Sweater Weather,” which had an accompanying — and equally dark — video. \n\nAlthough The Neighbourhood’s identity remained hazy, it became clear that the music they were making felt transformative to critics and fans alike. The evocative combination of rock instruments with R&B and hip-hop aesthetics seemed, in many ways, revelatory, a reimagining of sounds that seemed to make people clamor for more information with even greater fervor. In April, BBC Radio One DJ Zane Lowe, an early champion of the group, let it slip that The Neighbourhood was the handiwork of musician Jesse Rutherford, a resident of Newbury Park, CA. By early May, as the band unveiled a free, self-released EP titled “I’m Sorry,” it became understood that the identity of this young band was, ultimately, secondary to the music itself.",

The first recording group (Nicole Scherzinger, Melody Thornton, Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta, Kimberly Wyatt and Carmit Bachar) produced two albums and numerous singles between 2004 and 2009 including the world-wide hits \"Don't Cha\", \"Stickwitu\", \"Beep\", \"Buttons\", \"When I Grow Up\", \"I Hate This Part\", and \"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\". \"Stickwitu\" earned a 2005 Grammy Award nomination, and the Dolls brand diversified into merchandise, reality television programs, a Las Vegas act, product endorsements, spin-off recording groups (Girlicious, Paradiso Girls) and other ventures. By early 2010, the first Dolls recording group had disbanded. In 2009, Billboard ranked the Pussycat Dolls as the 80th most successful musical act of the 2000s.\n \nAs of 2011, The group sold 15 million albums and 37 million singles worldwide making them one of the best-selling girl groups of all time with a total of 52 million records.

        "strBiographyEN" : "The xx are an English indie pop band, formed in London in 2008. The group released their debut album, xx in August 2009. The album ranked highly on many best of 2009 lists, placing number one on the list compiled by The Guardian and second for NME. In 2010, the band won the Mercury Music Prize for their debut album.\nThe band met while studying at Elliott School, the same school that produced Hot Chip, Burial and Four Tet. The group, however, have downplayed the influence of the school on their career: \"A teacher from Elliott who had never even taught us said how great we were. It's a bit annoying. We were left alone, more than anything - although I'm sure that helped us in its own way.\" Oliver Sim and Romy Madley-Croft started the band as a duo when they were 15. Guitarist Baria Qureshi joined once they began performing in 2005, with Jamie Smith joining a year after.\nThe group's debut album, xx, was met with sweeping critical praise, achieving a rating of \"universal acclaim\" on Metacritic. The album also ranked well on \"best of the year\" lists, placing ninth on the Rolling Stone list and second for NME. In the 2009 NME The Future 50 list, The xx were positioned at number six, and in October 2009, they were named one of MTV Iggy's \"Top 10 Bands with Buzz\" (at the CMJ Music Marathon 2009).\nTheir self-titled debut was released with the British independent record label Young Turks on 17 August 2009. Though the band had previously worked with producers including Diplo and Kwes, they produced xx themselves, while Jamie Smith and Rodaidh McDonald mixed it. The xx recorded their album in a small garage that was part of the XL Recordings studio, often at night, which contributed to the low, whispery nature of the album. In August 2009, the band headlined their own concert tour. The xx have toured with artists including Friendly Fires, The Big Pink, and Micachu. In a first taste of success, their single \"Crystalised\" was featured on iTunes (UK) as Single of the Week, starting from 18 August 2009.\nThe music of the album was used extensively on television and in media such as 24/7, Person of Interest, NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games; during the series Cold Case, Suits, Mercy, the Greek version of Next Top Model, \"Bedlam\", Hung, 90210, as well as being the feature song for the March 2010 E4 advert for 90210, Misfits, the Karl Lagerfeld Fall/Winter 2011 fashion show, Waterloo Road, and the film I Am Number Four.\nIn late 2009, second guitarist and keyboardist Baria Qureshi left the group. Initial reports stated that this was due to exhaustion, but the band later said they made this decision due to \"personal differences.\" Later, Madley-Croft described the split as feeling \"like a divorce.\"\nIn January 2010, Matt Groening chose the band to headline two nights of his All Tomorrow's Parties festival in Minehead, England. In addition, the band played in five of North America's most popular music festivals, Coachella, Sasquatch, Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits. In May 2010, the track \"Intro\" was used by the BBC in their coverage of the 2010 general election. This led to the band playing the track on an episode of Newsnight.The song was also sampled in Rihanna's \"Drunk on Love\" from her album Talk That Talk, and played during the ending of the 2012 movie Project X and before the UEFA Euro 2012 matches at stadiums in Poland and Ukraine.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Timothy Zachery Mosley (born March 10, 1972) better known by his stage name Timbaland, is an American record producer, songwriter and rapper. Timbaland's first full credit production work was in 1996 on Ginuwine...the Bachelor for R&B singer Ginuwine. After further work on Aaliyah's 1996 album One in a Million and Missy Elliott's 1997 album Supa Dupa Fly, Timbaland became a prominent producer for R&B and hip-hop artists. As a rapper he initially released several albums with fellow rapper Magoo, but later released his debut solo album Tim's Bio in 1998. In 2007, Timbaland released the first album in his Shock Value series, Timbaland Presents: Shock Value. Then In 2009 Timbaland Presents: Shock Value II. It is expected that Timbaland will release Timbaland Presents: Shock Value III in 2012.\nTimothy Zachery Mosley was born on March 10, 1972 in Virginia Beach, Virginia, where he was raised. From birth he was diagnosed with a severe Tourettes Syndrome. Even in early life he showed very little aptitude for music, this has been said to have greatly influenced his avant-garde style in his later music career. He graduated from Salem High School. During his time as a DJ, he was known as \"DJ Tim\" or \"DJ Timmy Tim\". His brother, Sebastian, is nine years younger. Timbaland began making hip hop backing tracks on a Casio keyboard. While attending high school, he began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin Barcliff, who performed under the name of Magoo. The teenaged Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for surrounded by idiots) which also featured Neptunes producer Pharrell. Mosley was also high school friends with Terrence and Gene Thorton, who would go on to be known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse. In 1986, when Timbaland was 15 years old, he was shot while working a part time job at his local Red Lobster and was partially paralyzed for nine months. During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand.\nSinger and rapper Missy Elliott heard his material and began working with him. She and her R&B group Sista auditioned for DeVante Swing, a producer and member of the successful R&B act Jodeci. DeVante signed Sista to his Swing Mob record label and Elliott brought Mosley and Barcliff along with her to New York, where Swing Mob was based. It was DeVante who renamed the young producer Timbaland, after Timberland construction boots. and Magoo became part of SCI Zakys School stable of Swing Mob signees known as \"Da Bassment\" crew, joining artists such as R&B singer Ginuwine, male vocal group Playa (Smoke E. Digglera, Static Major and Digital Black), and the girl group Sugah. Timbaland did production work on a number of projects with DeVante, including the 1995 Jodeci LP The Show, The After-Party, The Hotel, and Sista’s (unreleased) début LP 4 All the Sistas Around da World. Elliott began receiving recognition as a songwriter for artists such as R&B girl group 702 and MC Lyte. Due to Timbaland's connection with her, he was often contacted to produce remixes of her songs.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Tijs Michiel Verwest,(born 17 January 1969), known as Tiësto, is a Dutch musician, DJ and record producer of electronic dance music. Although he has used many aliases in the past, he is best known for his work as DJ Tiësto. On his latest productions, however, he has dropped the \"DJ\" label and is now known simply as \"Tiësto\", an alias which is a twist of his childhood nickname.\nIn 1997, he founded the label Black Hole Recordings with Arny Bink, where he released the Magik and In Search of Sunrise CD series. Tiësto met producer Dennis Waakop Reijers in 1998, and the two have worked together extensively since then. Reijers is credited as producer, writer, composer, or arranger on many of Tiësto's releases. In 1999 and 2000 Tiësto collaborated with Ferry Corsten to create Gouryella. His 2000 remix of Delerium's \"Silence\" featuring Sarah McLachlan exposed him to more mainstream audiences. In 2001, he released his first solo album In My Memory which gave him several major hits that launched his career. He ranked in the #1 poll position 3 consecutive times in the DJ Magazine Top 100 Popularity Poll from 2002 to 2004.\nJust after releasing his second studio album Just Be in 2004 at the Summer Olympics, he performed live at the opening ceremony in Athens, Greece, becoming the first DJ to play live on stage at an Olympics. Tracks he made especially for the Olympics were mixed together and released as the mix compilation Parade of the Athletes later that year. In April 2007 Tiësto launched both his radio show Tiësto's Club Life on Radio 538 in the Netherlands and released his third studio album Elements of Life. The album reached number one on the Dutch album chart as well on \"Billboard Top Electronic Albums\" in the U.S. and received a nomination for a Grammy Award in 2008. Tiësto released his fourth studio album Kaleidoscope in October 2009.\nAs at 2012, Tiësto attained the #3 poll position of the DJ Mag 100 Popularity Poll, and he refers to the styles he mainly plays as House, Electro House, and Progressive House. He plays a new balanced sound sometimes demonstrating lesser known genres such as Dubstep. For nostalgia, Tiësto still throws in the odd Trance House record, the style he became attached to in the early 2000's",

He appeared at open-mic events nightly: \"It was full of humiliation: dragging a keyboard round, turning up to find out I’d been taken off the bill, gangs of lads grabbing the mic off me and laughing... I learnt to perform and learnt what songs work.\" After a year, he moved back to Chichester after being made redundant from his job as a barman. Using his grandmother's car, he travelled regularly to London to play shows and to put advertisements in music schools. He then moved to London to play as part of the band Tom and the Tides.

        "strBiographyEN" : "There are several artists with the name Topic. See also  German DJ Tobias Topic\n\nLife for ‘Topic’ began in West LA and evolved in West Covina throughout his adolescent years. The Yin and Yang lifestyle of religious based principles instilled by his mother and hard knock life experiences learned from his father laid the foundation on which this universal rap artist was formed.\n\nExtremely confident in his ability to write or rap about anything, hence the evolution of the epithet “Topic’. No literary form of expression can exist without a ‘Topic’. Having a true love for music since the early days of his youth, Topic began singing and writing his own lyrics in grade school. By the summer of 8th grade writing his first rhyme created a natural euphoria for the lyricist, and an addiction for which there is no cure, only temporary relief. In 1993, Topic had his first experience in a professional recording studio. He took advantage of the opportunity and learned all he could about the mechanics behind the development of a song.\n\nAn innate passion for writing combined with being outspoken and a natural leader, this lyricist is certain to accomplish what he wants. What he wants is to share his truth on different points of discussion by expressing them in his lyrics. There is truly no fear emanating from this man when a pen is in hand. In love with the lyrics that flow from his soul he stirs up the game on a mental level while stimulating your desire to move to the beat.\n\nAlong with staying modest, balancing confidence with humility and driven by a passion to spit the truth, Topic began performing in local clubs, competitions and underground spots throughout LA, the Inland Empire, and West Covina.

        "strBiographyEN" : "When she was 14, Tori Kelly started writing songs in the bedroom of her Southern California home. Within years she began sharing those songs online, and quickly won over Internet audiences with her sweetly soaring vocals, graceful guitar-playing, and knack for blending breezy melodies with boldly heart-on-sleeve lyrics. With her YouTube channel boasting more than 55 million views and almost 700,000 subscribers, the 20-year-old singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist is now at work on her debut album-- a passionate pairing of soul and pop that reflects both her lifelong devotion to music and uncommon authenticity as an artist.  \"One of the most important things to me as a songwriter is to make music that's young and fresh, but also soulful and real,\" says Kelly. \"I want people to feel like they know me once they listen to my songs.\" A musical purist who began singing at age three and learned to play drums and guitar by the time she was 16, Kelly forgoes over-the-top production in favor of laying bare her natural musicianship and ingenuity in songwriting. Bolstered by her easy magnetism as a performer, that potent combination helped her 2012 self-released EP Handmade Songs By Tori Kelly to debut at #6 on Soundscan's New Artist chart and at #9 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart. In creating the follow-up to Handmade Songs (which she wrote, produced, and mixed all on her own), Kelly has spent the better half of 2013 in the studio working to elevate her artistry while preserving the spirited simplicity of her sound.  The daughter of two musicians--Dad's a singer and bassist, Mom plays piano and saxophone--Kelly was raised with a deep love of music. \"Music was such a huge part of my life when I was growing up--I feel like it just comes second nature to me,\" says Kelly, a Southern California native of Puerto Rican, Jamaican, German, and Irish descent. While she lists artists as eclectic as Lauren Hill, Jill Scott, Jeff Buckley, and Maxwell as key inspirations, Kelly credits her early exposure to gospel singers like Crystal Lewis and J. Moss as a crucial influence on her moving and masterful vocal work. \"My parents just told me recently how, when I was younger, they made a point of never telling me to shut up--even when I wouldn't stop singing at the top of my lungs,\" she says. \"They always wanted to nurture whatever talent they saw in me.\"  Upon taking part in her first singing competition at age six, Kelly decided to dedicate her life to making music. \"I never had a plan B,\" she confesses. \"I just always knew this was what I was meant to do.\" Along with working with a coach to strengthen her vocal skills, Kelly also took up drums at age 12 and later moved on to guitar and piano. \"I didn't want to have to rely on anyone else to be my guitar player, so I just learned how to play it myself,\" she says. \"A family friend showed me a few chords, and after that I just started playing by ear.\"  For much of her early- to mid-teen years, Kelly focused on honing her songwriting and experimenting with self-production with the help of her computer's GarageBand app. During that time she began to gain a globe-spanning following through YouTube, thanks to her faithful posting of inspired covers and original songs that showcased her ethereal vocals and subtly confident guitar-playing. In early 2012, Kelly's online popularity skyrocketed when a YouTube video of her stripped-down, goosebump-inducing rendition of Frank Ocean's \"Thinkin Bout You\" went viral-- to date it's garnered over 17 million views. \"That was a crazy moment for me,\" recalls Kelly. \"It was just me singing and playing guitar and my friend Angie Girl beatboxing; we never expected it to get that kind of buzz. When that happened, I realized I needed to get more of my own music out into the world.\"  Released in May 2012, Handmade Songs featured six tracks performed entirely by Kelly (with the exception of her father's contributions on bass). \"The response to the EP was really cool, because I had no ties to any label--it was just my fans driving the whole thing,\" says Kelly. With Handmade Songs quickly climbing to the top ten on the iTunes pop chart, Kelly soon started playing shows at local coffeehouses to build more support for her music. Her very first coffeehouse show was attended by Scooter Braun (manager for artists like Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande and Carly Rae Jepsen), who has since become the manager of the singer/songwriter.  With the end of 2013 comes the release of Tori's EP 'Foreword' which debuted at #16 on the Top 200 with over 16,000 units sold in the first week. She capped off the week performing lead single and iTunes single of the week, 'Dear No One' on the Ellen DeGeneres show.  In the past year alone, Kelly has sold out shows in several major cities (including dates at The Troubadour & The Roxy in Los Angeles, Bowery Ballroom & Gramercy Theatre in New York City, and Bush Hall in London), headlined a nine-city sold-out U.S. tour, and supported Jewel and Ed Sheeran on tour. She has also graced the pages of Elle, Glamour, and Teen Vogue. But for Kelly, the fact that her evolution from Internet sensation to \"It girl\" took years of effort is a major point of pride. \"I'm really happy that none of this happened overnight, that it was a steady process where I learned from every stepping stone and my fans could all be a part of the experience with me,\" she says.  Kelly says she has no shortage of inspiration for new songwriting material. \"I'm still writing all the time, whether I'm in my room or out in the world and getting ideas down on my phone,\" she says. \"I can't go a day without making music.\" And when it comes to crafting songs for her debut album, Kelly asserts that her utmost ambition is to deliver honest, emotionally charged music that resonates with those who've supported her musical journey over the years. \"I'm always very real in my songwriting--I'm not trying to put on a mask or hide behind any kind of gimmick,\" she says. \"No matter what I'm going to do my own thing. So when people tell me that they relate to my songs, or that something I've written really connects with them, that's just the best feeling in the world.\"",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Vampire Weekend are an American indie rock band from New York City, that formed in 2006 and signed to XL Recordings. The band has four members: Ezra Koenig, Rostam Batmanglij, Chris Tomson, and Chris Baio. The band released its first album Vampire Weekend in 2008, which produced the singles \"Mansard Roof\", \"A-Punk\", \"Oxford Comma\" and \"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\". The band's most recent album, Contra, was released in 2010.\nMembers of the band met while in Columbia University, beginning with a \"serious\" rap collaboration between Koenig and Tomson. They bonded over a shared love of punk and African music, and in fact Koenig had gone on tour with The Dirty Projectors during a period of experimentation with African music, inspiring the band to incorporate world sounds into their earliest work. They chose the name Vampire Weekend from the title of a short film project by Koenig. Koenig believes that the vampire imagery of their band name helped spread their work across the internet, attracting people who might otherwise never have listened to their music. The band began playing shows around Columbia, starting with a battle of the bands at Lerner Hall. After graduating from college, the band self-produced their debut album while simultaneously working full time jobs, Tomson as a music archivist and Koenig as a middle school English teacher.\nIn 2007, Vampire Weekend's song \"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\" was ranked 67th on Rolling Stone's list of the '100 Best Songs of the Year'. In November 2007, they toured the UK with The Shins. Success came to the band in the now common form of blog hype and internet buzz, built during the year that their album was on the internet before its official release. The internet attention led to a large pre-release following, which in fact enabled them to go on three full tours before their debut album dropped. They were declared \"The Year's Best New Band\" by Spin magazine in the March 2008 issue, and were the first band to be shot for the cover of the magazine before releasing their debut album. Four songs from the band's first album also made the Triple J Hottest 100, 2008. The internet hype had its backlash, however, as anti-fans and critics reacted against a perceived image of Vampire Weekend as rich, privileged ivy league graduates stealing from foreign musicians. One critic went so far as to call Vampire Weekend the \"whitest band in the world\", to which they took exception, given their Ukrainian, Persian, Italian and Hungarian heritages. Such reactions were not repeated for later world music inspired musicians, suggesting Vampire Weekend may have cleared the way for their style of fusion. Furthermore, this backlash was largely unfounded, as Koenig would later explain some band members got into Columbia on scholarship and that he himself is still paying off student loans.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "There are at least six artists with this name:\n1. Willow Smith, an American pop singer\n2. An American instrumental group\n3. A Belgian indie rock band\n4. An American singer/songwriter\n5. A Dutch rock band\n6. An American math rock band\n7. Sophie Wilson, a UK-based producer.\n\n1. Willow Camille Reign Smith (born October 31, 2000 in Los Angeles, United States) is an American child actress and singer who is the daughter of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. She made her acting debut in 2007 in the film I Am Legend, and was most successful in the film Kit Kittredge: An American Girl where she won the Young artist award for Best Performance in a Feature Film. Apart from her acting she launched a music career in the fall of 2010 with the release of her debut single “Whip My Hair” and signing to Jay-Z’s record label Roc Nation. She will now look to release an album sometime in early 2011.\n\n2. Willow was a four piece instrumental group from Newnan, GA.\nKyle Coleman-Drums/Fast Driving, Matt McClellan-Bass/Keys/Jingle Bells, Tanner Merritt-Guitar/Funny Faces & Rob Sepanski-Mandolin/Violin/Noise \n\n3. Willow is a young Belgian indie rock band that started in 2007. They create solid, semi-danceable, catchy popsongs with hints of new wave. In their short existence Willow won several rockcontests, with most notably Rockvonk 2009. In 2010 they became 3rd in Humo’s Rock Rally and won the KBC public’s choice award. They are known for their energetic live performance and their refreshing take on music history while still being capable of maintaining their own sound.\n\n4. Willow is a self-taught singer/songwriter, who, in 1992 put down her Bible and picked up a pawn shop guitar. Three chords later, the songs came flowing out. Judging from the fact that she had no subsequent musical experience, one could say she’s a bit of a preternatural chanteuse. Like post-Christian rocker contemporaries, Alice Cooper and Marilyn Manson, Willow’s papa is a preacher man and prior to her fateful leap, she was an enrollee at Multnomah School of the Bible in Portland Oregon. The result of her departure from conservative religion…her musical renderings are of an evolution of a spiritual nature - an earthly, poetic dance in the dark. For those familiar with the fire and brimstone of artist Nick Cave, Willow may be the polar sweet angel of darkness, redemption and desire.\n\n5. Willow was a rock-band from The Hague, The Netherlands. The band was formed by Marlein Heskes-Duarte and Rui Duarte. They’ve had multiple guitar players in the 6 years they made music. The music also changed everytime a new guitar player entered the band. Started out as an alternative rock band, they soon changed their sound to a more punk-rock sound, and in the last year added a nu-metal vibe to their sound.\nWillow had some succes in their hometown and surroundings, having played more than a 100 shows, including the Paard van Troje, Plein Open festival, HOT festival and recorded a videoclip in the local tv-studio “TV West” for the song Spinning Around.\nThe Duarte’s have recently started a new band called Man-Made Madness, which also includes ex-Willow guitar-player Jordy Licht.\n\n6. Willow is a math rock trio from Providence, Rhode Island, United States. Their debut EP, \"Roanoke\" was issued in 2012.\n\n7. Sophie Wilson AKA Willow first made her introduction in 2014 when her debut Feel Me caused a stir when ambient techno veteran Move D included it on his Fabric 74 mix. A year later, the song finally received a proper release on Workshop's compilation EP Workshop 21 – the sub-heavy house tune with an earworm R&B vocal was a highlight on the LP which was number 6 in Resident Advisor tracks of 2015.\n \nRewind two years to the start of an on-going residency in Nottingham for 808, the chance to play alongside Anton Zap, Fred P, Tama Sumo and of course Move D, have shaped and crafted her tastes and DJ style which ranges from house to techno and all that falls in-between.

Westlife had sold over 45 million records worldwide which includes studio albums, singles, video release, and compilation albums. Despite the group's worldwide success, they only had one hit single in the United States, \"Swear It Again\", which peaked in 2000 on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 20. The band were originally signed by Simon Cowell and were managed by Louis Walsh. The group had accumulated 14 number-one singles in the United Kingdom, the third-highest in UK history, tying with Cliff Richard.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Wham! was a pop band formed in 1981 from Bushey, England. They were briefly known in the United States as Wham! UK due to a naming conflict with another band.\nGeorge Michael and Andrew Ridgeley met at Bushey Meads School in Watford, England. At first, they performed in a short-lived rock and roll band called The Executive. They then changed their name and signed with Innervision Records. Soon after a legal victory over Innervision, the duo was signed to CBS, Columbia Records in the United States and Canada and Epic Records for the rest of the world. \nMichael took on the majority of roles and responsibilities within the band— composer, singer, producer, and occasional instrumentalist— but the contribution of Ridgeley as the group’s image specialist and spokesman was crucial to the band’s initial success. Ridgeley convinced a reluctant George that Wham! needed to change their image and sound frequently, from the leather-clad moody singers of “Bad Boys” and “Young Guns (Go For It!)” to the more fashionable pop superstars of “Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go.”\nStill teenagers, they promoted themselves as hedonistic youngsters, proud to live a carefree life without work or commitment. This was reflected in their earliest singles. Such works as “Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do?)” have been seen as sarcasm advocating the other point of view.\nThe first record to be released by the band was “Wham Rap!”. It was a double-A side with a Social Mix and Anti-social Mix. The record was banned for general release in the UK due to the profanity in the Anti-social Mix.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Wisin & Yandel is a Puerto Rican reggaeton duo, composed of Juan Luis Morera Luna (Wisin) and Llandel Veguilla Malavé (Yandel). They started their career in 1998 and have been together since, winning several awards during that time. In late 2013, they announced to take a pause in their careers as a duo, after their Líderes tour. According to Yandel, they have not disbanded. \n\nMusic career:\n\nBeginning (1998-2004):\nIn 1998, Wisin & Yandel participated in the album No Fear 3, produced by DJ Dicky as well as on the compilation album The Mission Vol. 1, edited by Fresh Production label. The success of this collection (which was certified gold) led the label to produce Los Reyes del Nuevo Milenio, the first album by Wisin & Yandel. \nFrom that moment the duo started a successful career. They continued posting new topics in the successive editions of The Mission and recorded three new albums: De Nuevos a Viejos (2001), Mi Vida... My Life (2003) and De Otra Manera (2004), all of which were certified gold. The duo also received the Tu Música Award for Best Rap/Reggaeton Duo in 2002. \n\nIn 2004, the duo released two separate solo efforts: El Sobreviviente by Wisin and Quien Contra Mí by Yandel, which sparked speculation about a possible separation. Sales of the albums were unimpressive, and the duo remained together. \n\nPa'l Mundo and WY Records (2005-06):\nThe duo started their own label under the name of WY Records. In 2005, they released their first album under it, Pa'l Mundo, which became their most successful album to date. The album reached international status when it reached countries like China, Japan and some European countries. The album also peaked at #1 on Billboard '​s Top Latin Albums and was certified gold by RIAA. After the success of Pa'l Mundo, Wisin & Yandel released Los Vaqueros in 2006, which featured appearances of WY Records artists like Franco \"El Gorila\", Tony Dize, and Yomille Omar, as well as guest artists like Don Omar and Hector el Father. \n\nInternational consolidation (2007-12):\nOn November 7, 2007, Wisin & Yandel released the album Los Extraterrestres, which featured collaborations with international artists like Eve and Fat Joe.

After organizing concerts throughout Latin America and Europe, Wisin & Yandel noted that they would like to expand their markets to Africa and Australia. Wisin & Yandel participated in the closing ceremonies of the 2008 Viña del Mar Festival. The tickets for the event sold out, which the duo described as a \"real honor\".

They also made a guest appearance in an album titled Caribbean Connection released on June 24, 2008. The production featured several Latin American artists including Daddy Yankee, Don Omar and Hector \"El Father\" along Jamaican musicians like Inner Circle, Bounty Killer, Elephant Man and Wayne Wonder. \n\nOn July 19, 2008, the duo made a presentation before a sold-out crowd in Venezuela. The duet were selected to perform in \"KQ Live Concert\" on September 27, 2008, organized by KQ 105 FM, which included several Puerto Rican and Latin American artists. On August 12, 2008, the mayor of their hometown of Cayey, Rolando Ortíz Velázquez, recognized Wisin & Yandel as \"Ambassadors from Cayey to the world\" during the city's annual Fiesta patronal. On April 24, 2009, Wisin & Yandel received the Latin Rhythm Album of the Year, Duo Or Group Latin Billboard Music Award for Los Extraterresres.

Early April, 2014 Wisin said on Radio Fórmula: \"I think that late 2015 or 2016 we're ready with a new album as Wisin & Yandel -- This is just a facet; it's a pause to refresh ourselves to make something different.\" Late in August 2014, Yandel said: \"Wisin & Yandel is a registered trademark, we always work together -- We are now providing separate projects, will soon be seen together again.\" \nWisin is currently working on his second solo album, El Regreso del Sobreviviente and Yandel completed his first solo tour this year, promoting his second solo album De Líder a Leyenda.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, baptismal name Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart (27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791), was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era.\nMozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, he was engaged as a court musician in Salzburg, but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position, always composing abundantly. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized. He was survived by his wife Constanze and two sons.\nMozart learned voraciously from others, and developed a brilliance and maturity of style that encompassed the light and graceful along with the dark and passionate. He composed over 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence on subsequent Western art music is profound; Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote that \"posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years.\"",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Wu-Tang Clan is a New York City rap group with the MCs/Producers RZA, GZA/Genius, Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa hailing from Staten Island, Brooklyn and Bronx. They have gone on to become multi-platinum record producers, Grammy winners, TV and film stars, screenwriters, product spokespersons, business owners and, most recently, major motion picture composers. The Clan featured nine MCs until the death of Ol’ Dirty Bastard in 2004. One of the most critically and commercially successful hip hop groups of all time, Wu-Tang Clan shot to fame through their uncompromising brand of hardcore rap music. Since their debut, they have introduced or launched the careers of numerous other artists and groups, and already in 1994 there were credited to be over 300 Wu-Tang Clan affiliates, known as the Wu-Tang Killa Bees, consisting of rappers, producers, and record label CEOs.\n\nThe founders of the Wu-Tang Clan were RZA, GZA, and Ol’ Dirty Bastard, who had previously formed the group Force of the Imperial Master (later known as All In Together Now after the release of a popular single by that name). The group attracted the attention of some notable figures in the industry, including Biz Markie, but did not manage to secure a record deal. After the crew dissolved, GZA and RZA (then known as Prince Rakeem) embarked on their solo careers with Cold Chillin’ Records and Tommy Boy Records respectively, but to little success. Their frustration with the workings of the hip hop music industry would provide the main inspiration to Wu-Tang Clan’s revolutionary business plan. According to The Wu-Tang Manual, at the group’s inception, RZA promised the members that if he had total control of the Wu-Tang empire, it would conquer the hip hop world within a dynastic cycle, after which he would relinquish his total control.\n\nWu-Tang Clan was gradually assembled in late 1992 from friends and accomplices from around Staten Island, New York, with RZA as the de-facto leader and the group’s main producer. Two of the cousins, GZA (pronounced Jizza) and RZA (pronounced Rizza), created their new Wu-Tang aliases by mimicking the sound that the words “genius” and “razor” would make when scratched on a turntable.\n\n“Wu-Tang” comes from the name of the Taoist holy mountain Wu Dang in northwest Hubei Province in central China; it was also the site of the Ming Dynasty Purple Imperial City built during the reign of the Yongle Emperor in the early 15th century. RZA and Ol’ Dirty Bastard adopted the name for the group after seeing the kung fu film Shaolin and Wu Tang, which features a school of warriors trained in Wu-Tang style. The group’s debut album loosely adopted a Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang theme, dividing the album into Shaolin and Wu-Tang sections and using dialogue excerpts as skits.\n\nThe group have also developed various backronyms for the name (as hip hop pioneers like KRS-One and Big Daddy Kane did with their names), including “We Usually Take All the Niggas’ Garments,” “Witty Unpredictable Talent and Natural Game” and “Wisdom, Universe, Truth, Allah, Nation, and God”.\n\nMethod Man has also mentioned that the “Wu” is the sound a sword makes when cutting through the air, and “Tang” is the sound it makes against a shield.\n\nThe Clan first became known to hip hop fans, and to major record labels, in 1993 (see 1993 in music) following the release of the independent single “Protect Ya Neck”, which immediately gave the group a sizeable underground following. Though there was some difficulty in finding a record label that would sign Wu-Tang Clan while still allowing each member to record solo albums with other labels, Loud/RCA finally agreed, releasing their debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), in late 1993. This album was popular and critically-acclaimed, though it took some time to gain momentum. Though hip hop had long had a gritty texture, the surreal aggression and minimalist production of 36 Chambers nevertheless had a huge impact on the genre, and was to prove massively influential over the next decade. By the beginning of the 21st century, the album had become a regular fixture on “Best Albums of the 90s” lists as well as a frequent choice for “Best Albums of All Time” lists. The success of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) established the group as a creative and influential force in early 1990s hip hop, allowing GZA, RZA, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa to negotiate solo contracts.",

He began writing music after being released from a juvenile detention center and released his first song on SoundCloud in June 2013, titled \"News/Flock\". He was a popular figure in SoundCloud rap, a trap scene that takes elements of lo-fi music and harsh 808s. Well known for his \"depressing, and at times devastating\" music that brought attention to mental health, Onfroy employed styles and techniques that were unconventional in hip hop during his career, such as distortion and heavy guitar-backed instrumentals drawing inspiration from third-wave emo.\nOn June 18, 2018, Onfroy was shot and fatally wounded at the age of 20, in a robbery at a motorcycle dealership in Deerfield Beach, Florida.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Wisin & Yandel is a Puerto Rican reggaeton duo, composed of Juan Luis Morera Luna (Wisin) and Llandel Veguilla Malavé (Yandel). They started their career in 1998 and have been together since, winning several awards during that time. In late 2013, they announced to take a pause in their careers as a duo, after their Líderes tour. According to Yandel, they have not disbanded. \n\nMusic career:\n\nBeginning (1998-2004):\nIn 1998, Wisin & Yandel participated in the album No Fear 3, produced by DJ Dicky as well as on the compilation album The Mission Vol. 1, edited by Fresh Production label. The success of this collection (which was certified gold) led the label to produce Los Reyes del Nuevo Milenio, the first album by Wisin & Yandel. \nFrom that moment the duo started a successful career. They continued posting new topics in the successive editions of The Mission and recorded three new albums: De Nuevos a Viejos (2001), Mi Vida... My Life (2003) and De Otra Manera (2004), all of which were certified gold. The duo also received the Tu Música Award for Best Rap/Reggaeton Duo in 2002. \n\nIn 2004, the duo released two separate solo efforts: El Sobreviviente by Wisin and Quien Contra Mí by Yandel, which sparked speculation about a possible separation. Sales of the albums were unimpressive, and the duo remained together. \n\nPa'l Mundo and WY Records (2005-06):\nThe duo started their own label under the name of WY Records. In 2005, they released their first album under it, Pa'l Mundo, which became their most successful album to date. The album reached international status when it reached countries like China, Japan and some European countries. The album also peaked at #1 on Billboard '​s Top Latin Albums and was certified gold by RIAA. After the success of Pa'l Mundo, Wisin & Yandel released Los Vaqueros in 2006, which featured appearances of WY Records artists like Franco \"El Gorila\", Tony Dize, and Yomille Omar, as well as guest artists like Don Omar and Hector el Father. \n\nInternational consolidation (2007-12):\nOn November 7, 2007, Wisin & Yandel released the album Los Extraterrestres, which featured collaborations with international artists like Eve and Fat Joe. The album was received positively by the Puerto Rican media, with mainstream newspaper Primera Hora awarding it a score of 4 out of 5. The review praised the fusion of styles found in the album, claiming that the production continued the \"musical evolution\" found in its predecessors. \n\nFollowing the release of Los Extraterrestres the duo commenced an international promotional tour. After organizing concerts throughout Latin America and Europe, Wisin & Yandel noted that they would like to expand their markets to Africa and Australia. Wisin & Yandel participated in the closing ceremonies of the 2008 Viña del Mar Festival. The tickets for the event sold out, which the duo described as a \"real honor\".

They also made a guest appearance in an album titled Caribbean Connection released on June 24, 2008. The production featured several Latin American artists including Daddy Yankee, Don Omar and Hector \"El Father\" along Jamaican musicians like Inner Circle, Bounty Killer, Elephant Man and Wayne Wonder. \n\nOn July 19, 2008, the duo made a presentation before a sold-out crowd in Venezuela. The duet were selected to perform in \"KQ Live Concert\" on September 27, 2008, organized by KQ 105 FM, which included several Puerto Rican and Latin American artists. On August 12, 2008, the mayor of their hometown of Cayey, Rolando Ortíz Velázquez, recognized Wisin & Yandel as \"Ambassadors from Cayey to the world\" during the city's annual Fiesta patronal. On April 24, 2009, Wisin & Yandel received the Latin Rhythm Album of the Year, Duo Or Group Latin Billboard Music Award for Los Extraterresres. Besides this recognition, the duo also received nominations for \"Ahora Es\" and \"Síguelo\" in the Tropical Airplay Song of the Year, Duo Or Group and Latin Rhythm Airplay Song of the Year, Duo Or Group categories. \nIn May 2009, Wisin & Yandel released their next album La Revolución, which featured rapper 50 Cent.

On October 15, 2009, Wisin & Yandel won the Latin American MTV Award for \"Artist of the Year\" and \"Video of the Year\". In 2011, the duo released Los Vaqueros: El Regreso which peaked at #1 on several charts. \nOn April 30, 2012, the duo announced that they will be the opening act for Spanish singer Enrique Iglesias and American artist Jennifer Lopez at the Enrique Iglesias and Jennifer Lopez in Concert but later decided to opt out on June 29, 2012. Their album Líderes has a release date of July 3, 2012. Wisin & Yandel have both decided to release solo albums in 2013. Wisin's \"El Regreso del Sobreviviente\" was released on March 18, 2014.

Early April, 2014 Wisin said on Radio Fórmula: \"I think that late 2015 or 2016 we're ready with a new album as Wisin & Yandel -- This is just a facet; it's a pause to refresh ourselves to make something different.\" Late in August 2014, Yandel said: \"Wisin & Yandel is a registered trademark, we always work together -- We are now providing separate projects, will soon be seen together again.\" \nWisin is currently working on his second solo album, El Regreso del Sobreviviente and Yandel completed his first solo tour this year, promoting his second solo album De Líder a Leyenda. In September 2014, they both confirmed to be working in a new track that would premiere and be performed first time on Yandel's De Líder a Leyenda tour on October 4, at the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico. \n\nLos Lideres clothing line:\nIn November 2011, Wisin & Yandel launched the \"Los Lideres\" clothing line in association with Marc Ecko, founder and Chief Creative Officer of Marc Eckō Enterprises.

The Claws mix up every genre which is within a sense of playing, from the electronic stuff like House and Electro, to Dubstep and all the way back to the Classics with HipHop and R&B. Add some of Bizzey's most catchy lines and hooks and there you have it, one of the most innovating and entertaining club nights known to mankind. Besides our clubtour through the Netherlands we also did some of the biggest Dutch festivals like DirtyDutch Festival, Stereo Sunday Festival, Solar Festival Roermond, Dreamfields Festival, Sneakerz Festival, Zomerkriebels, Salvationz, Latin Village Festival, Solar Festival and Welle Village.   Yellow Claw started as a regular clubnight at one of Amsterdam's most famous clubs, the Jimmy Woo, but has since then grown into something much bigger. Hitting the big-time in 2012 with \"Allermooiste Feestje\" and \"Krokobil,\" the Yellow Claw boys have established themselves as the next big thing to come out of the Netherlands.",

        "strBiographyEN" : "Zac Brown Band is an American country, Southern rock, bluegrass, reggae and folk band based in Atlanta, Georgia. The lineup consists of Zac Brown (lead vocals, guitar), Jimmy De Martini (fiddle, vocals), John Driskell Hopkins (bass guitar, vocals), Coy Bowles (guitar, keyboards), Chris Fryar (drums), Clay Cook (guitar, keyboards, mandolin, steel guitar, vocals), and Daniel de los Reyes (percussion). The band has toured throughout the United States, including a slot on the 2009 and 2010 Bonnaroo Music Festival. They have also recorded four studio albums, and charted eight Number One singles on the Billboard country charts: \"Chicken Fried\", \"Toes\", \"Highway 20 Ride\", \"Free\", \"As She's Walking Away\", \"Colder Weather\", \"Knee Deep\" and \"Keep Me In Mind\", in addition to the singles \"Whatever It Is\" and \"No Hurry\", which peaked at number 2 on the same chart.\n\nBrown attended the University of West Georgia, where he was a member of the Zeta Kappa chapter of the Kappa Alpha Order fraternity. He was also a camp counselor at Camp Mikell in Toccoa, Ga. & Camp Glisson, a United Methodist summer camp located in Dahlonega, GA. Zac Brown was born in Vienna in the Georgian Republic located in eastern Europe.\n\nIn 2002, the Zac Brown Band was formed and they began traveling with a heavy tour schedule of approximately 200 dates a year. The initial Zac Brown Band lineup consisted of Brown, on acoustic guitar and lead vocals, backed by a drummer and a bass guitarist. In 2003, Brown started his own label, called Home Grown (today, it is called Southern Ground for legal reasons).\n\nIn 2004, Brown opened a music club and restaurant with his father in the Lake Oconee area of Georgia called \"Zac's Place\" where the fare was southern-style cooking. A developer bought the restaurant and, in turn, the Zac Brown Band bought a tour bus and began touring full-time, playing rock and country clubs as well as folk and jam band festivals. 2004 also saw the release of the Zac Brown Band's first independent album, Far from Einstyne.\n\nIt was also in 2004 when Brown added violinist/fiddler and tenor vocalist Jimmy De Martini to the Zac Brown Band, thus beginning Brown's five-year quest to develop the band's current lineup. According to an interview with De Martini, he explained that Wyatt Durette, Brown's frequent songwriting collaborator, was working as a bartender at Sidelines Sports Bar in Kennesaw, Georgia at the time, where the Zac Brown Band frequently performed. Durette suggested De Martini to Brown, who was wanting a \"lead instrument\" in his band, as well as a harmony singer. After doing several performances with the band at the club, Brown asked De Martini to become a full-time member, to which he gladly obliged.\n\nIn 2005, the Zac Brown Band released its second independent album, Home Grown. That same year, John Driskell Hopkins joined the band as its bass guitarist and baritone vocalist. Hopkins, who was well known in the Atlanta area as the leader of the band Brighter Shade, first met Brown in 1998 at an open mic event hosted by Hopkins and they remained friends since. Additionally, Hopkins also co-produced the Zac Brown Band's Home Grown album.",

He primarily produces in the electro house genre, but has branched out, drawing influences from progressive house, complextro and dubstep.\nAnton is a classically trained musician, born from two musicians, who began playing the piano and drums at the age of four. In 2002 he began playing for the German band, Dioramic, signed by Lifeforce Records. Anton's interest in producing electronic music was piqued after hearing 'â€ ' by French electronic duo Justice. He began producing electronic music in 2009.\nUnder the name 'Zedd', Anton has produced a wide variety of remixes and originals. He first made waves in the scene when he won two different Beatport remix contests; his first original release, 'The Anthem', broke into the Beatport Electro house Top 20. His remix of Skrillex's \"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\" broke into the Beatport Electro House Top Ten charts, coming to rest at #2. He has since produced remixes of well-known artists of the likes of The Black Eyed Peas, Fatboy Slim, Skrillex, and more. Anton creates his music using the Cubase suite of music production applications, and takes advantage of different plug-ins including the Sylenth1, Nexus and Omnisphere synthesizers.\nIn 2011, Zedd's remixes of Lady Gaga's tracks \"Born This Way\" and \"Marry the Night\" would appear on the Born This Way Deluxe Edition releases. In September, Zedd's single \"Shave It\" was premiered as a thirty second teaser on Skrillex's YouTube page, this being Zedd's first release on OWSLA records.\nIn 2012, Zedd signed with Interscope Records and released his debut single from the label, Spectrum, with vocals by Matthew Koma.

        "strBiographyEN" : "Zion & Lennox are a reggaeton duo from Carolina, Puerto Rico. As of 2010, Zion & Lennox released their 3rd studio album titled Los Verdaderos under Pina Records. \n\nCareer:\nThey have been in the music business for a long time.They had minor hits such as \"Baila Conmigo\" for the 2003 compilation album \"Desafío\" and \"Me Pones Tensión\" for the album The Noise: La Biografía. These hits, along with others in the near future and increased radio play gave them more recognition. This gave them the chance to appear in major Reggaeton albums such as Luny Tunes' Mas Flow (2003) and Mas Flow 2 (2005), Blin Blin vol.1 (2003-4), Contra la Corriente (2004), and Cazadores, Primera Búsqueda (2005). \nIn May 2004, they released their first solo album, Motivando a la Yal. With hits such as \"Doncella\", \"Bandida\", and \"Yo Voy\" (featuring Daddy Yankee), the album reached gold certification. With the reggaeton genre becoming a worldwide phenomenon, Zion and Lennox's popularity increased. Motivando a la Yal: Special Edition was released a year later. The special edition had new songs along with remixed songs of the previous edition, such as \"Don't Stop\", \"Bachatéalo\", a remix to the song \"Bandida\", and a hip-hop remix of \"Yo Voy\" with Miri Ben-Ari, Fatman Scoop, and Pitbull entitled \"Jump & Spread Out (DJ Precise and Cheeky Starr Version)\". \nBoth Zion and Lennox are very active with solo songs. Zion has been more notable with songs like \"Yo Voy a Llegar\" for Reggaeton producer DJ Nelson's compilation album Flow la Discoteka, \"Alócate\" released on Luny Tunes's album Mas Flow 2.5, and \"Con Ella Me Quedare\" released in the fifth installment of the Alex Gargolas series, entitled Gargolas: The Next Generation. He also has turned up a new hit, \"Que Pasara\", for DJ Nelson's Flow la Discoteka 2. Zion has released a solo album entitled The Perfect Melody on June 5, 2007, with appearances by artists such as Akon and Play-n-Skillz. \"The Way She Moves\" is the lead single from the album and features Akon. Lennox has been working on songs on his own album, but has also been very active in bringing new artist to his label \"Toma Enterprise\". The label is set to release an album named Los Mero Meros. \nZion y Lennox's music is much different than mainstream reggaeton. What truly distinguishes them from other artists is that they typically sing about love and relationships, similar to RKM y Ken-Y(in 1970s R&B fashion) and refrain from the typical obscene sex, drugs and violence lyrics heard in a lot of other reggaeton and hip hop songs. \nAfter three years of building their fan base and positive reputation with guest spots and compilation records, Zion & Lennox released their first full-length record, Motivando a la Yal. The record featured the work of renowned producers Luny Tunes, Noriega, Nely \"El Arma Secreta\", and Eliel, some of the most visible the style had to offer. Thanks to the record's success as it hit the charts with force, Zion & Lennox toured all over the Americas, performing before large and appreciative audiences. Soon industry demand and personal pressure caused Zion & Lennox to go in different directions. Boldly boasting to be one of the greatest singers ever to hail not only from Puerto Rico but all of Latin America, Ortiz started his own record label, Baby Records, for whom he is the flagship act and CEO. Lennox continues to make guest appearances and collaborate with important genre artists. It came after a lengthy discussion in a New York hotel in which they parted amicably. Recently, as of February 8, 2008, Zion y Lennox are on a \"reunited\" tour. They also set the reggaeton world on notice slating a November 2008 release of their latest effort which has yet to be publicly titled. Zion participated in a beach festival named \"Back to School\", on August 9, 2008. In early 2010, they joined and signed a contract with Pina Records appearing on the compilation album Golpe De Estado (2010). \n\nPersonal life:\nZion & Lennox are Afro-Puerto Ricans who grew up together in the town Carolina, Puerto Rico enjoying similar musical tastes, such as hip hop, dancehall, and rap. Lennox is the younger brother of Mackie of the reggaeton duo, Yaga & Mackie.",

The band was founded by Morten Harket (vocals), Magne Furuholmen (keyboards), and Pål Waaktaar (guitars). The group initially rose to fame during the mid 1980s after being discovered by musician and producer John Ratcliff and had continued global success in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nA-ha achieved their biggest success with their debut album, Hunting High and Low, in 1985. That album peaked at number 1 in their native Norway, number 2 in the UK and number 15 on the U.S. Billboard album chart, yielded two international number-one singles, \"Take on Me\" and \"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\", and earned the band a Grammy Award nomination as Best New Artist. In the UK, Hunting High and Low continued its chart success into the following year, becoming one of the best-selling albums of 1986. In 1994, after their fifth studio album, Memorial Beach which failed to achieve the commercial success of their previous albums, the band went on a hiatus.\n\nFollowing a performance at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 1998, the band returned to the studio and recorded their sixth album, 2000's Minor Earth Major Sky, which was another number-one in Norway and resulted in a new tour. A seventh studio album, Lifelines, was released in 2002, and an eighth album, Analogue, in 2005, was certified Silver in the UK — their most successful album there since 1990's East of the Sun, West of the Moon. Their ninth album, Foot of the Mountain, was first released on 19 June 2009 and returned the band to the UK Top 5 for the first time since 1988, being certified Silver there and Platinum in Germany. The album peaked at number 2 in Norway (their first not to reach number 1 in their home territory). On 15 October 2009, the band announced they would split after a worldwide tour in 2010, the Ending On A High Note tour. Thousands of fans from at least 40 different countries on six continents congregated to see A-ha for the last time.\n\nThe band have sold over 36 million albums and 15 million singles worldwide. In less than a year, during 2010, the band earned an estimated 500 million Norwegian Kroner on touring tickets, merchandising and release of a greatest hits album, making them one of the 40–50 largest grossing bands in the world.",

In their second year of studies, Joe showed Gwil a handful of his own songs inspired by his guitar-playing dad and hallucinogens, and the pair began recording in their dorm rooms with Gwil acting as producer on GarageBand. The band spent two years rehearsing before inking a deal with Infectious Records in 2011.\nΔ's name is pronounced alt-j, which is the command used on a Mac keyboard to achieve the Greek letter \"Delta\". Guitarist and bassist Gwil Sainsbury noted, \"in mathematical equations it's used to show change\" and the band’s relatively new name came at a turning point in their lives. \"alt-J\" were formerly known as both 'Daljit Dhaliwal' and 'Films'.",
